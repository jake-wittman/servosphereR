## Patch
This is a small patch to my package.It was brought to my attention that some of
the help documentation was not readable due to an error in writing them.

## Test environments
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2

# R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

R-hub flagged possible misspellings in a NOTE. These are not misspelled.

This is a new submission.
