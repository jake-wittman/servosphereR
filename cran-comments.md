## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I expanded the Description field in my DESCRIPTION file to provide more details about the analysis tools in this package. A link to the Syntech website was included in the DESCRIPTION file, as well as links to sources that provided inspiration for the development of this package and detail some of the methods involved in studying the movement behavior of insects.

## Test environments
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2

# R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

R-hub flagged possible misspellings in a NOTE. These are not misspelled.

This is a new submission.
