## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I expanded the Description field in my DESCRIPTION file to provide more d etails about the analysis tools in this package. No citations were added that describe the methods in my package, as these methods were all developed by me. The examples in my function documentation have also been edited to provide executable examples.

## Test environments
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2

# R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

R-hub flagged possible misspellings in a NOTE. These are not misspelled.

This is a new submission.
