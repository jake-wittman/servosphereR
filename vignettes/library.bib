abstract = {I NTRODUCTION Investigations into the nature of the chemical senses of lepidopterous larv@@e have been few. Mclndoo (1919) demonstrated the existence of an olfactory sense,but no one has made a special study of the gustatory sense. It is the purpose of this paper to present data on the gustatory thresholds for sucrose, dextrose, and hydrochloric acid and data on the olfactory threshold for ethyl alcohol; to locate and describe the sense organs involved; and to show what part these two sensesplayin the selection of food plants. I wish to express my sincere thanks to Professor C. T. Brues and Professor T. J. B. Stier for their help and criticism during the course of thisinvestigation. Gipsy moth caterpillars (Porthetria dispar)were employed as suit able test subjects for the determination of the taste threshold of various substances. Each insect was tested individually and the gastronomic history of each followed. One which would accept water was eliminated because this was taken as a sign that the animal would accept indiscriminately any liquid offered to it. If the water was refused, drops of sucrose in dilutions of .0001M, .001 M, .01 M, .1M, .5M and 1M were offered in succession and the point noted where the larva accepted the drop. From this it appears that P. dispar larv2e can taste sucrose solutions as dilute as .1M. This threshold varies slightly with individuals as some respond only to .5M solutions. The threshold appears to be independent of the temperature changes occurring in the natural en vironment @f the larvae and independent of larval age. Fatigue of the organs of taste, if it occurs, must be negligible as no indication of this was observed. By presenting the solutions in alternation with water and at vari able strengths, it was shown that most larv@iecould distinguish between .1M and .5M. 7 This content downloaded from 131.104.023.010 on June 29, 2018 06:55:32 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).},

abstract = {Studies in ecology are often describing observed variations in a certain ecological phenomenon by use of environmental explanatory variables. A common problem is that the numerical nature of the ecological phenomenon does not always fit the assumptions underlying traditional statistical tests. A text book example comes from pollination ecology where flower visits are normally reported as frequencies; number of visits per flower per unit time. Using visitation frequencies in statistical analyses comes with two major caveats: the lack of knowledge on its error distribution and that it does not include all information found in the data; 10 flower visits in 20 flowers is treated the same as recording 100 visits in 200 flowers. We simulated datasets with various "flower visitation distributions" over various numbers of flowers observed (exposure) and with different types of effects inducing variation in the data. The different datasets were then analyzed first with the traditional approach using number of visits per flower and then by using count data models. The analysis of count data gave a much better chance of detecting effects than the traditionally used frequency approach. We conclude that if the data structure, statistical analyses and interpretations of results are mixed up, valuable information can be lost.},

abstract = {Adult bees and wasps provide all the food their offspring require to grow from egg to adult. For a given diet. offspring body size generally increases with an increase in the amount of food consumed as a larva, but the extent to which body size is influenced by the type of food consumed is poorly known. Pollen ranges from 2-60{\%} protein among plant species, and bees are extremely efficient at assimilating nitrogen; therefore, it seems likely that either parent bees adjust the size of larval provisions to compensate for differences in pollen protein concentration or bee offspring attain different body size depending on the pollen type(s) consumed as a larva, We presented the generalist sweat bee Lasioglossum zephyrum with pollen diets that differed in protein content and monitored offspring body size during two experiments. In a protein supplementation experiment, diets ranged from 20-66{\%} protein and consisted of Typha pollen amended with soy protein. On a pollen/soy diet, offspring body size increased 25{\%} with a shift from 20-37{\%} protein, but did not increase further at greater protein concentrations, In a multiple pollen experiment, pollen diets ranged from 20-39{\%} protein and consisted of eight pollens that differed naturally in protein concentration. The largest offspring arose from the most protein-rich pollens, whereas much smaller bees developed on protein-poor pollens, Provision size only predicted offspring size when pollen type, and therefore protein quantity, was considered. Adult foragers did not adjust provision size to compensate for pollen protein, Therefore, offspring body size appears to result from a combination of controlled (provision size) and uncontrolled (pollen quality) factors that arise out of bee foraging decisions.},

Detected colonies are treated using Bacillus thuringiensis or mating disruption. Analyses to date indicate that this project has reduced spread by more than 50 percent.},

abstract = {Wind structure and dispersal of gypsy moth larvae, Lymantria dispar (L.), were simulated using a three-dimensional wind and dispersion model. In particular, the springtime wind patterns of coastal California near Monterey Bay, an area of current infestation, were simulated using climatological data. These mass-conserved winds were then used to simulate the trajectories of gypsy moth larvae with terminal velocities ranging from 40 cm per second to 120 cm per second. Small-scale convective processes which would carry the larvae aloft were simulated through the random location of buoyant plumes in the modeled area. Three hundred simulations were made in order to determine the probability of long-range airborne transport of larvae. The larvae were carried aloft and transported more than a few hundred meters in only 2{\%} of the cases. Dispersal under these 2{\%} of the cases in which long-range transport occurred was then examined in detail for larvae with terminal velocities of 40, 80, and 120 cm s-1. Model results showed that the larvae with a 120 cm s-1 terminal velocity were transported 7 km and resulted in a maximum concentration of 49 larvae per hectare based on 1 million larvae at the source. The larvae with a terminal velocity of 40 cm s-1 were transported 21 km with a maximum concentration of 14 larvae per hectare. While the results shown in this paper are geographically specific, the model is fully exportable since it is based on a direct solution of the equations describing those physical processes. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, spends the majority of its life cycle within the phloem of pine trees, experiencing exposure to temperatures below Ϫ30ЊC in many parts of their expansive range. To better understand cold tolerance capabilities of this insect, seasonal patterns of cold-hardiness, as measured by supercooling points in the laboratory, were compared with seasonal patterns of host tree phloem temperatures at several geographic sites for 2 beetle generations. Larvae were found to be intolerant of tissue freezing, and supercooling points measured appear to be a reasonable estimate of the lower limit for survival. Of the compounds analyzed, glycerol was found to be the major cryoprotectant. No differences in supercooling points were found among instars or between larvae collected from the north and south aspect of tree boles. Both phloem temperatures and supercooling points of larvae collected from within the phloem were found to be different among the geographic sites sampled. Mountain pine beetle larvae appear to respond to seasonal and yearly {\ss}uctuations in microhabitat temperatures by adjusting levels of cold hardening.},

abstract = {Recent data on biological invasion show that range expansion is driven by various modes of dispersal such as neighborhood diffusion and long-distance dispersal that occur side by side within a species. In such a stratified dispersal process, the initial range expansion mainly occurs by neighborhood diffusion. However, as the range of the founder population expands, new colonies created by long-distance migrants increase in number to cause an accelerating range expansion in the later phase. We classify several well-documented examples of geographical expansions into three major types depending on the nonlinearity of the range-versus-time curve. To examine how long-distance dispersal produces accelerating range expansion, we construct a stratified diffusion model, which describes the dynamics of the size distribution of colonies created by long-distance migrants. The model consists of a von Foerster equation combined with a Skellam model. Analyzing the model provides an estimate of range expansion in terms of the rate of expansion due to neighborhood diffusion, the leap distance, and the colonization rate of long-distance migrants. The results explain various types of nonlinear range expansion observed in biological invasions.},

Although there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, we suggest that there is no unique best way to analyze data. Further, we argue that, although multimodel inference can be useful in natural resource management, the importance of considering causality and accurately estimating effect sizes is greater than simply considering a variety of models. Determining causation is far more valuable than simply indicating how the response variable and explanatory variables covaried within a data set, especially when the data set did not arise from a controlled experiment. Understanding the causal mechanism will provide much better predictions beyond the range of data observed.},

abstract = {Butterflies of the genus Papilio have polarisation-sensitive photoreceptors in all regions of the eye, and different spectral types of receptor are sensitive to different e-vector orientations. We have studied the consequences of this eye design for colour vision in behavioural tests and find that Papilio spp. see false colours due to the polarisation of light. They discriminate between vertically and horizontally polarised light of the same colour in the contexts of oviposition and feeding. The discrimination depends on the spectral composition of the stimuli. In the blue and probably in the green range, discrimination does not depend on intensity. However, colour discrimination is influenced by polarisation. Thus, colour and polarisation processing are not separated in the visual system of Papilio spp. From these results, we propose hypotheses about which photoreceptors contribute to colour vision in Papilio spp. and what adaptational value such a system might have for the butterflies. Finally, we give examples for other eyes that have a similar structure.},

@article{Hassell1978,
abstract = {The evolutionary fitness of an animal depends significantly upon an optimal diet in both quantity and quality. Foraging strategies are therefore rigorously shaped by natural selection and should be considered in terms of the degree to which they maximize the net nutrient gain from feeding, and to which they minimize the risks to survival. Any discussion of foraging behavior is complicated by the forager's perceiving the environment at several hierarchical levels. We endeavor to categorize these, being fully aware that any such framework is bound to be plagued with exceptions and examples of blurred boundaries. Our classification includes three such levels: the habitat, the patch, and the food item. Of these, the food items are generally the easiest to define. They are the prey of predators, the hosts of parasitoids, the leaves for caterpillars, the feeding sites for mosquitoes, the nectaries and anthers for bees, and so on. Such items are almost invariably heterogeneous in their spatial distribution, which makes it appropriate for us to identify an aggregation of food items-a "patch"-as the next level in the hierarchy. The definitions of what should and should not constitute a patch have been various (174, 179). We look upon patches as spatial subunits of the foraging area in which aggregations of food items occur. A patch is most readily identified when the food items are distributed among discrete natural units, as are, for exam­ ple, prey on leaves. But we must beware of identifying a patch solely by what we perceive or consider reasonable. The forager itself defines the patch, and we should look to changes in the forager's behavior to identify patch boundaries. A patch in these terms is therefore an area containing a stimulus or stimuli that at the proper intensity elicit a characteristic foraging activity in a responsive forager (174). Such a definition, rather than one based on the forager's response itself, avoids attributing more patches to the environment of a responsive forager than to that of an unrespon­ sive one. 7S},

abstract = {The intimate details regarding the coevolution of bats and moths have been elucidated over the past 50 years. The bat-moth story began with the evolution of bat sonar, an exquisite ultrasonic system for tracking prey through the night sky. Moths countered with ears tuned to the high frequencies of bat echolocation and with evasive action through directed turns, loops, spirals, drops, and power dives. Some bat species responded by moving the frequency and intensity of their echolocation cries away from the peak sensitivity of moth ears, and the arms race was on. Tiger moths countered by producing anti-bat sounds. Do the sounds advertise moth toxicity, similar to the bright coloration of butterflies; do they startle the bat, giving the moth a momentary advantage in their aerobatic battle; or do they jam the sonar of the bat? The answer is yes. They do all and more in different situations and in different species. Any insect that flies at night must deal with bat predation. Beetles, mantids, true crickets, mole crickets, katydids, green lacewings, and locusts have anti-bat strategies, and we have just scratched the surface. In an exciting new twist, researchers are taking the technologies developed in the laboratory back into the field, where they are poised to appreciate the full richness of this remarkable predator-prey interaction.},

abstract = {Larvae of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) are a major pest of vine, Vitis vinifera. As larvae have limited energy reserves and are in danger of desiccation and predation an efficient response to plant volatiles that would guide them to food and shelter could be expected. The responses of starved 2nd or 3rd instar larvae to volatile emissions from their artificial diet and to single host plant volatiles were recorded on a locomotion compensator. Test products were added to an air stream passing over the 30 cm diameter servosphere. The larvae showed non-directed walks of low rectitude in the air stream alone but changed to goal-oriented upwind displacement characterised by relatively straight tracks when the odour of the artificial diet and vapours of methyl salicylate, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, terpinen-4-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were added to the air stream. This chemoanemotactic targeted displacement illustrates appetence for certain volatile cues from food by starved Lobesia larvae. Analysis of the larval behaviour indicates dose dependent responses to some of the host plant volatiles tested with a response to methyl salicylate already visible at 1 ng, the lowest source dose tested. These behavioural responses show that Lobesia larvae can efficiently locate mixtures of volatile products released by food sources as well as single volatile constituents of their host plants. Such goal-oriented responses with shorter travel time and reduced energy loss are probably of importance for larval survival as it decreases the time they are exposed to biotic and abiotic hazards. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an invasive insect that has caused significant ash ( Fraxinus spp.) mortality in North America. Three Chinese parasitoids have been approved for release as part of a classical biological control program for A. planipennis in the United States: Spathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), and Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). This study was designed to measure the cold tolerance of the overwintering stage for each parasitoid species in the laboratory. We exposed cold-acclimated and non-cold-acclimated individuals to temperatures from 0 to -35. ??C to determine temperatures that cause body fluids to freeze, mortality after brief exposure, and mortality after long-term exposure. Cold acclimation lowered the supercooling points of S. agrili (median -28.8. ??C) and T. planipennisi (median -29.4. ??C). Median supercooling point for Oobius agrili was -30.5. ??C. Cold acclimation also increased survival of diapausing S. agrili (50{\%} mortality at -27.3 versus -23.7. ??C for non-diapausing S. agrili) during brief cold exposure. T. planipennisi and S. agrili mortality increased over long term cold exposure when held at constant temperature. Half of T. planipennisi are predicted to fail to eclose after exposure to 0, -5, -10, and -15. ??C after *84, 82, 59, and 36. days, respectively, while 50{\%} of S. agrili with diapause induced in one generation would be discolored from cold injury *84. days for all exposure temperatures. Our models characterizing parasitoid mortality due to cold exposure can be used to assess the climatic suitability of a location prior to release. ?? 2013 .},

-Tetrastichus seems the least cold hardy and is probably chill intolerant, although they suspected there was issues in handling the larvae that resulted in higher mortality
-Chill acclimation improved SCP for Spathius agrili, but not really in Tet
-If the lower lethal temp 50 is above the SCP CI, then the insect is likely chill intolerant.},

abstract = {Computer simulations were run to examine the effects of Ooencrytus kuvanae (Howard) parasitism on gypsy moth populations. Two difference equation models were used, one, a simple theoretical model containing only a few important components, the other, a more comprehensive model with component functions based on field data. The simulations of the first model showed that O. Kuvanae cannot control gypsy moth populations by itself. Egg parasitism was most important during the outbreak and collapse phase of the gypsy moth population cycle, and was of little importance in the endemic phase. The endemic phase was, however, lower and lasted longer with O. kuvanae parasitism than without. Simulations with the second model generally supported these conclusions. The second set of simulations also demonstrated that due to the non-linearity of the density dependence of O. kuvanae parasitism, they gypsy moth populations could be forced into a chaotic regime (unstable, aperiodic population behavior). The variation in parasitism rate from the simulations was compared with that of field populations and found to be essentially the same, indicating that the simulation models are realistic. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {Insect cold tolerance mechanisms are often divided into freezing tolerance and freeze intolerance. This division has been criticised in recent years; Bale (1996) established five categories of cold tolerance. In Bale's view, freezing tolerance is at the extreme end of the spectrum of cold tolerance, and represents insects which are most able to survive low temperatures. Data in the literature from 53 species of freezing tolerant insects suggest that the freezing tolerance strategies of these species are divisible into four groups according to supercooling point (SCP) and lower lethal temperature (LLT): (1) Partially Freezing Tolerant-species that survive a small proportion of their body water converted into ice, (2) Moderately Freezing Tolerant-species die less than ten degrees below their SCP, (3) Strongly Freezing Tolerant-insects with LLTs 20 degrees or more below their SCP, and (4) Freezing Tolerant Species with Low Supercooling Points which freeze at very low temperatures, and can survive a few degrees below their SCP. The last 3 groups can survive the conversion of body water into ice to an equilibrium at sub-lethal environmental temperatures. Statistical analyses of these groups are presented in this paper. However, the data set is small and biased, and there are many other aspects of freezing tolerance, for example proportion of body water frozen, and site of ice nucleation, so these categories may have to be revised in the future. It is concluded that freezing tolerance is not part of Bale's (1996) continuum, but rather a parallel, alternative strategy of cold tolerance.},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the {\$}p{\$}-values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

abstract = {The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a diurnal insect that strongly relies on visual cues to guide its walk. In the present study, we investigated the orientation behavior of non-diapausing walking CPB in response to emissive colors produced by light emitting diodes (LEDs) in a dual choice arena adapted to a servosphere, where the only illumination available came from the photo-stimuli. Our results demonstrate that CPB show positive phototactic behavior when stimulated with different wavelengths of light; they preferred to orient towards white (420–775 nm), ultraviolet (UV) (351 nm), blue (472 nm), green (570 nm), yellow (585 nm), orange (590 nm), and red (660 nm) over darkness when both alternatives were offered, but no orientation responses were elicited by infrared (940 nm). Both males and females preferred yellow and green over other colors, but did not show any particular preference between them, thus correlating with their preference for wavelengths reflected by vegetation. Sexual differences were noted in that male CPB preferred white over either red or UV, whereas female CPB did not show any preferences when offered these colors. Female CPB preferred UV and blue over red, whereas males showed no preferences when these colors were offered. Colorado potato beetles turned at higher angles and performed more tortuous walks in complete darkness and when infrared vs. darkness were offered compared with the rest of the colored lights. Both sexes preferred continuous over pulsed yellow light. Colorado potato beetles subjected to pulsed yellow light showed a temporal alteration of their walking performance by walking less, slower, and turning at a higher rate. The results are discussed with regard to the role of color in the CPB attraction to host plants and conspecifics as well as the role of intermittent photic stimuli in their orientation behavior. The information provided here provides a basis for the improvement of trapping devices for detection and survey of incipient or invasive CPB, and development of alternate control strategies for this important pest of potatoes and other solanaceous crops.},

We examined whether information on host competence alone could be used to accurately predict the effects of an invasive host on disease in native hosts. We first characterized the relative competence of an invasive species and a native host species to a native parasite. Next, we manipulated species composition in mesocosms and found that host competence results did not accurately predict community dynamics.

Growth rates of tent caterpillars in the field are greater than that expected for the average ambient temperature of 150, and closely approximate growth in the laboratory at 25?, near the average Tb exhibited in the field.

Much is now known about the ways in which insects cope with the ice-water threshold, and with the low temperatures that precede it. Recent work has demonstrated a diversity of physiological responses to cooling and freezing in insects, with extremes of temperature, rates of temperature change, the numbers of freeze-thaw transitions, climatic unpredictability and the state of the surrounding microhabitat being important factors determining the cold tolerance strategy adopted by an insect. Insect low temperature biology now integrates techniques ranging from laboratory-based functional genomics to climatology, making it not only intrinsically fascinating, but also of considerable relevance to investigations of the biological implications of climate change.},

The majority of emerald ash borers survive winter as freeze-intolerant prepupae. In winter, A. planipennis prepupae have low supercooling points (∼−30°C), which they achieve by accumulating high concentrations of glycerol (∼4M) in their body fluids and by the synthesis of antifreeze agents. Cuticular waxes reduce inoculation from external ice. This is the first comprehensive study of seasonal changes in cold tolerance in a buprestid beetle.},

abstract = {This essay grew out of an examination of one-tailed significance testing. One-tailed tests were little advocated by the founders of modern statistics but are widely used and recommended nowadays in the biological, behavioral and social sciences. The high frequency of their use in ecology and animal behavior and their logical indefensibility have been documented in a companion review paper. In the present one, we trace the roots of this problem and counter some attacks on significance testing in general. Roots include: the early but irrational dichotomization of the P scale and adoption of the `significant/non-significant' terminology; the mistaken notion that a high P value is evidence favoring the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis; and confusion over the distinction between statistical and research hypotheses. Resultant widespread misuse and misinterpretation of significance tests have also led to other problems, such as unjustifiable demands that reporting of P values be disallowed or greatly reduced and that reporting of confidence intervals and standardized effect sizes be required in their place. Our analysis of these matters thus leads us to a recommendation that for standard types of significance assessment the paleoFisherian and Neyman-Pearsonian paradigms be replaced by a neoFisherian one. The essence of the latter is that a critical [alpha] (probability of type I error) is not specified, the terms 'significant' and 'non-significant' are abandoned, that high P values lead only to suspended judgments, and that the so-called "three-valued logic" of Cox, Kaiser, Tukey, Tryon and Harris is adopted explicitly. Confidence intervals and bands, power analyses, and severity curves remain useful adjuncts in particular situations. Analyses conducted under this paradigm we term neoFisherian significance assessments (NFSA). Their role is assessment of the existence, sign and magnitude of statistical effects. The common label of null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) is retained for paleoFisherian and Neyman-Pearsonian approaches and their hybrids. The original Neyman-Pearson framework has no utility outside quality control type applications. Some advocates of Bayesian, likelihood and information-theoretic approaches to model selection have argued that P values and NFSAs are of little or no value, but those arguments do not withstand critical review. Champions of Bayesian methods in particular continue to overstate their value and relevance.},

abstract = {1. Outbreaks of insect pest populations are common and can have devastating effects on natural communities and on agriculture. Little is known about the causes of these outbreaks or the causes of en masse migrations during outbreaks. 2. Flightless Mormon crickets (Anabrus simplex) were the focus of this study. They are a katydid species that forms large, dense, mobile groups (migratory bands) during outbreak periods, eating vegetation in their path. 3. Radiotelemetric methods were used to measure differences in movement rate and directionality in outbreak and non-outbreak populations, testing the hypothesis that these populations differ in their travel rate and consistency of direction. 4. Daily individual movement in outbreak populations differs substantially from non-outbreak populations that are at much lower density. In addition to large differences in distances travelled (1.6 km as compared with 1 m) and rates of travel, there is evidence for collective movement among individual Mormon crickets travelling in migratory bands. 5. These data suggest that the direction of group movement may be influenced by local environmental conditions such as wind direction and movement of nearby band members. This work forms the basis for ongoing work testing hypotheses about mass migrations in outbreak populations.},

abstract = {The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire is a serious invasive forest pest of ash (Fraxinus) trees in North America. Life tables were constructed for both experimentally established cohorts and wild populations of A. planipennis on healthy host trees from 2008 to 2011 in six forests in central Michigan. Life table analysis showed that the net population growth rates (R0) for the experimental cohorts (16.0±2.9) and associated wild A. planipennis (19.4±1.9) were the highest for the first study period (2008-2009) at three Ingham Co. sites but decreased to 4.7±0.9 and 4.6±0.4, respectively, for the second (2009-2010) study period at the same sites. By contrast, R0 values of both experimental cohorts (5.7±2.2) and associated wild A. planipennis populations (11.3±2.5) were intermediate in the third (2010-2011) study period at different sites in the Gratiot and Shiawassee Cos. The sudden decrease in R0 of both experimental and wild A. planipennis cohorts in the Ingham Co. sites corresponded with increases in parasitism by hymenopteran parasitoids Atanycolus spp. (native) and Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (introduced), as well as an increase in woodpecker predation, indicating the role of these natural enemies in regulation of the pest's population dynamics.},

Since volatiles often vary in space and time, herbivores (especially polyphagous ones) may be able to use these compounds as cues to track variation in host plant qual- ity based on their innate abilities and previous experience.We investigated the behavioral response of na{\"{i}}ve (fed on artificial diet) and experienced (fed on poplar) gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillars, a polyphagous species, towards constitu- tive and herbivore-induced black poplar (Populus nigra)vol- atiles at different stages of herbivore attack. In Y-tube olfac- tometer assays, both na{\"{i}}ve and experienced caterpillars were attracted to constitutive volatiles and volatiles released after short-term herbivory (up to 6 hr). Na{\"{i}}ve caterpillars also were attracted to volatiles released after longer-termherbivory (24– 30 hr), but experienced caterpillars preferred the odor of un- damaged foliage.Amultivariate statistical analysis comparing the volatile emission of undamaged plants vs. plants after short and longer-term herbivory, suggested various compounds as being responsible for distinguishing between the odors of these plants. Ten compounds were selected for individual testing of caterpillar behavioral responses in a four- arm olfactometer. Na{\"{i}}ve caterpillars spent more time in arms containing (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate than in solvent permeated arms, while avoiding benzyl cyanide and salicyl aldehyde. Experienced caterpillars avoided benzyl cy- anide and preferred (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) over solvent. Only responses to DMNT were significantly different when comparing experienced and na{\"{i}}ve caterpillars. The results show that gypsy moth caterpillars display an in- nate behavioral response towards constitutive and herbivore- induced plant volatiles, but also that larval behavior is plastic and can be modulated by previous feeding experience.},

@article{Zachariassen1985,
abstract = {From the available experimental data a relatively clear picture can be established with regard to the physiological importance of some of the mechanisms involved in insect cold hardening. In freeze-avoiding insects, all potent ice-nucleating agents are removed or inactivated, leading to a depression of the supercooling points to about 20 degrees C. Accumulation of polyols causes a further depression with a magnitude of about twice the corresponding melting-point depression. Production of thermal hysteresis factors causes a stabilization of the supercooled state. In freeze-tolerant insects, potent ice-nucleating agents are produced in the extracellular body fluid, ensuring a protective extracellular freezing at a few degrees below zero. Accumulation of polyols causes a steep drop in the lethal temperature, due to a reduction of the amount of ice by a colligative mechanism. However, there is still much to be learned about the mechanisms by which ice-nucleating agents, polyols, and thermal hysteresis agents are acting. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the production and elimination of these components from the body fluid of the insects are not understood. Also, when it comes to the influence of environmental factors, like photoperiod and temperature, there is much to be learned. In addition to giving attention to these topics, future research should be focused on the possible role of other factors in cold hardening such as bound water, dehydration, low-molecular-weight solutes other than polyols, and the biochemical mechanisms forming the basis of the seasonal changes in the cold hardiness of insects.},

The leaf-sheets differing in size but subtending identical visual angles at different distances elicited an equal larval response. Even when presented a choice between two leaf-sheets subtending identical visual angles at two different distances, the larvae showed an equal response to both. Thus, the larval orientation was determined by the visual angles subtended by the leaf-sheets rather than their linear dimensions and distances. The larval responses could be related with the horizontal and visual angles of the leaf-sheets by a regression equation. The leaf-sheets with irregular or wavy margins also elicited the same larval response as the equivalent leaf-rectangles with straight margins. The orientation of larvae to two leaf-sheets, offered together as a choice on two sides, showed varying degrees of deviations from the responses to the same sheets presented singly.

As a result, producers and consumers have become quite dependent on insecticides for the production of inexpensive and esthetically pleasing foods (Chagnon and Payette 1990; Storch 1996). The availability, relatively low cost, high efficiency and ease of application of insecticides continue to ensure that they will remain the control method of choice, despite the known deleterious effects on human and environmental health. However, increasing public and media awareness of the negative side effects, erosion of the existing pesticide arsenal, and the steady development of insecticide resistance have encouraged and led to a renewal of interest in alternative control methods (e.g. Duchesne and Boiteau 1996).},

abstract = {1. Inference about demographic parameters of animal and plant natural populations is important to evaluate the consequences of global changes on populations. Investigating the factors driving their variation over space and time allows evaluating the relative importance of biotic and abiotic variables in shaping the dynamics of a population. Although numerous studies have identified the factors possibly affecting population dynamics, they have barely formally determined the routes by which these different factors are related to demographic parameters. 2. We focus on mark–recapture (MR) models that provide unbiased estimators of demographic parameters,while explicitly coping with imperfect detection inherent to wild populations.MRmod- els allow estimating the effect of covariates on demographic parameters and testing their signifi- cance in a regression-like framework. However, these models can only detect correlations and do not inform on causal pathways (e.g. direct vs. indirect effects) in the relationships between demo- graphic parameters and the factors possibly explaining their variability. 3. We develop an integrated model to perform path analysis (PA) ofMRdata, to examine causal relationships among several (including demographic) variables. This approach is implemented in a Bayesian framework usingMarkov chainMonte Carlo. 4. To motivate our developments, we analyse 17 years of mark–recapture data from Atlantic puf- fins (Fratercula arctica), to investigate the mechanisms through which environmental conditions have an impact on puffins' adult survival. Using our PA-basedMRmodelling approach, we found that local climatic conditions had an indirect and lagged impact on puffin survival through their influence on local abundance of herring. Besides, we found no evidence for any lagged effect through an alternative unknownpathway (e.g. abundance of another resource). 5. Our method allows elucidating pathways through which environmental, trophic or density- dependent factors influence demographic parameters, while accounting for detectability{\textless}1.This is a critical step to understand the interactions of a species with its environment and to predict the impacts of global change on its viability.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that soil animal count data are characterized by the presence of excess zeros and overdispersion, which violate the assumptions of standard statistical tests. Despite this, analyses have consisted of mainly non-parametric tests and log-normal least square regression (i.e. ANOVA). Failure to accommodate zero inflation in count data can result in biased estimation of ecological effects jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific inference. The objective of this study was to compare statistical models for the analysis of soil animal count data and suggest appropriate methods for estimating abundance. The log-normal regression model, linear mixed model (LMM), standard Poisson, Poisson with correction for overdispersion (PCO), negative binomial distribution (NBD), the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models were compared using 12 count data sets of earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, beetles, ants and termites from soils under the miombo woodland and agroforestry systems in eastern Zambia. The NBD with covariates gave a better description of the data in nine out of 12 cases than did the standard Poisson, ZIP and ZINB. The ZIP and ZINB models with covariates gave the best description of earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts from agroforestry, respectively. In all cases, the ZIP model was better than the standard Poisson model. The ZINB was inferior to the NBD except for earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts in agroforestry. Significance tests based on the PCO, ZIP, NBD and ZINB were more conservative than those based on the standard Poisson model. The 95{\%} confidence intervals computed using the PCO, ZIP, NBD and ZINB were also wider than those computed using least squares, LMM and assuming Poisson distribution. It is concluded that for the comparison among habitat types, land-use categories or treatments, the NBD, ZIP and ZINB perform better than the log-normal and Poisson models. Considering the excess-zero problem and significant deviation of soil animal counts from the assumptions of normality and homoscedcity, the log-normal regression model is inappropriate. Therefore, routine application of the log-normal regression model and non-parametric tests for analysis of soil animal count data with many zeros should be discouraged. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Low-density populations of gypsy moth, Lymantria ia dispar, were studied over a 10-yr period in Massachusetts. Increases in gypsy moth density were associated with declines in density of the white-fooled mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, a principal predator. Furthermore, changes in density of P. leucopus populations were positively correlated with the density of acorn crops, a dominant winter food sourer for these mice. To demonstrate these effects we used a novel bootstrap regression method that adjusts for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the time series data. The findings are compatible with a dual equilibrium model of gypsy moth population dynamics, in which low densities are regulated by mice and high densities are regulated by other factors, notably a virus disease.},

abstract = {Multiple regression, the General linear model (GLM) and the Generalized linear model (GLZ) are widely used in ecology. The widespread use of graphs that include fitted regression lines to document patterns in simple linear regression can be easily extended to these multivariate techniques in plots that show the partial relationship of the dependent variable with each independent variable. However, the latter procedure is not nearly as widely used in ecological studies. In fact, a brief review of the recent ecological literature showed that in ca 20{\%} of the papers the results of multiple regression are displayed by plotting the dependent variable against the raw values of the independent variable. This latter procedure may be misleading because the value of the partial slope may change in magnitude and even in sign relative to the slope obtained in simple least-squares regression. Plots of partial relationships should be used in these situations. Using numerical simulations and real data we show how displaying plots of partial relationships may also be useful for: 1) visualizing the true scatter of points around the partial regression line, and 2) identifying influential observations and non-linear patterns more efficiently than using plots of residuals vs fitted values. With the aim to help in the assessment of data quality, we show how partial residual plots (residuals from overall model + predicted values from the explanatory variable vs the explanatory variable) should only be used in restricted situations, and how partial regression plots (residuals of Y on the remaining explanatory variables vs residuals of the target explanatory variable on the remaining explanatory variables) should be the ones displayed in publications because they accurately reflect the scatter of partial correlations. Similarly, these partial plots can be applied to visualize the effect of continuous variables in GLM and GLZ for normal distributions and identity link functions.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim The rate at which introduced insects disperse into novel habitats is a key determinant of the impacts of biological invasions and the efficacy of importation biological control programs. Understanding which life‐history traits or abiotic factors moderate spread rates is important for designing trapping and eradication programs for invasive insects and for designing release protocols of imported natural enemies. Our aim was to identify variables that can explain variation in spread rates of introduced insects. Location Global. Spread rates from 30 different countries were compiled. Time period 1976–2014. Major taxon studied Insecta. Methods We compiled 147 published spread rates of 86 non‐native insects. Spread rates were averaged per species so that each insect was only represented once in statistical analyses. Simultaneously, we collected information on several variables associated with the introduced insects such as adult longevity, diet breadth, diet preference, eusociality, fecundity, taxonomic order, role of passive dispersal (important versus not important), size, type (invasive species versus biological control agent), voltinism (i.e., the number of generations per year) and duration of spread. In addition to analysis of the complete data set, analyses of several subsets of the data were conducted to determine robustness and sensitivity of findings. Results In the global analysis, voltinism was clearly the most significant predictor of spread rates. Insects with more than one generation per year spread faster than those with one or fewer generations. Analyses limited to either invasive species or importation biological agents further confirmed that multivoltine insects spread faster on average than univoltine insects. Main conclusions Whereas previous work has shown that accidentally introduced insects spread faster than those introduced intentionally, the identification of voltinism as a key predictor of spread may enhance risk analyses and accuracy of forecasting, especially where a changing climate may alter patterns of voltinism.},

abstract = {Estimating rates of spread and generating projections of future range expansion for invasive alien species is a key process in the development of management guidelines and policy. Critical needs to estimate spread rates include the availability of surveys to characterize the spatial distribution of an invading species and the application of analytical methods to interpret survey data. In this chapter, we demonstrate the use of three methods, (i) square-root area regression, (ii) distance regression and (iii) boundary displacement, to estimate the rate of spread in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, in the USA. Th e gypsy moth is a non-native species currently invading North America. An extensive amount of spatial and temporal distributional data exists for this invader. Consequently, it provides an ideal case study to demonstrate the use of methods to estimate spread rates. We rely on two sources of data: (i) polygonal data obtained from county quarantine records describing the geographical extent of gypsy moth establishment; and (ii) point data consisting of counts of male gypsy moths captured in pheromone-baited traps used to detect and monitor newly established gypsy moth populations. Both data sources were compiled during the gypsy moth's invasion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, USA. We show that even with spatially crude county records of infestation, spread rates can still be estimated using relatively simple mathe-matical approaches. We also demon strate how the boundary displacement method can be used to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of spread.},

abstract = {The hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria, is an economically important insect pest of Canadian forests which overwinters as eggs. Although the hemlock looper causes extensive damages, no information on the mechanisms related to its cold tolerance is known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature and exposure duration on hemlock looper winter survival but also to identify seasonal supercooling capacity and cryoprotectant levels of three populations along a latitudinal gradient. As host plant may contribute to offspring overwintering success, cold tolerance of hemlock looper eggs from parents whose larvae were fed on three different tree species was also measured. Mean supercooling point (SCP) of hemlock looper eggs was lower than -30°C from October through the following spring with values being as low as -47°C in February. Trehalose was the most abundant sugar found in hemlock looper eggs with a peak concentration of 0.3$\mu$gmg-1DW-1. Glycerol, a polyol, was more often absent in eggs of the different populations and tree species tested in the study. When exposed to different temperature regimes for various periods of time, significant mortality of hemlock looper eggs occurred at higher temperatures than the mean SCP. Thus, hemlock looper could be considered as a chill tolerant species. No clear pattern of population and host plant effects on SCP and cryoprotectants was detected in this study. However, when exposed to different winter temperatures and exposure duration, hemlock looper from higher latitudes survived better (survival rates ranging between 0 and 89{\%} at -20°C) than those from lower latitudes (survival rates ranging between 0 and 56{\%} at -20°C). Our results may contribute to a better understanding of hemlock looper winter biology and thus facilitate predictions of outbreaks and range expansion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Humans have always had close relationships with forest but since 2005 most people live in cities or urbanised areas. This has profoundly shifted the kind of relationship people have with forests. Instead of being sources of utilitarian prod- ucts, forests are increasingly valued for their benefi ts for physical and mental health and wellbeing. Different forest types, such as wilderness areas, managed production forests or urban forests offer different possibilities. Effects on the physical environ- ment of urban areas, such as pollution reduction or temperature mitigation help to provide healthier places to live while the ability to see or to visit green areas close to home helps to reduce stress, to provide settings for relaxation, socialising and physical exercise and provides aesthetic pleasure. Much recent research has strengthened the evidence base for these benefi ts and public health policy in many Western countries is beginning to take the results seriously. However the research is focussed at present in Western countries, while the mega-cities with poorest envi- ronments are in developing countries. It is here that the gaps in research and the challenges for the future are to be found.},

abstract = {1. Perhaps no other pair of variables in ecology has generated as much discussion as species richness and ecosystem productivity, as illustrated by the reactions by Pierce (2013) and others to Adler et al.'s (2011) report that empirical patterns are weak and inconsistent. Adler et al. (2011) argued we need to move beyond a focus on simplistic bivariate relationships and test mechanistic, multivariate causal hypotheses. We feel the continuing debate over productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) provides a focused context for illustrating the fundamental difficulties of using bivariate relationships to gain scientific understanding. 2. Pierce (2013) disputes Adler et al.'s (2011) conclusion that bivariate productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) are “weak and variable.” He argues, instead, that relationships in the Adler et al. data are actually strong and, further, that failure to adhere to the humped-back model (HBM; sensu Grime 1979) threatens scientists' ability to advise conservationists. Here we show that Pierce's reanalyses are invalid, that statistically significant boundary relations in the Adler et al. data are difficult to detect when proper methods are used, and that his advice neither advances scientific understanding nor provides the quantitative forecasts actually needed by decision makers. 3. We begin by examining Grimes' HBM through the lens of causal networks. We first translate the ideas contained in the HBM into a causal diagram, which shows explicitly how multiple processes are hypothesized to control biomass production and richness and their interrelationship. We then evaluate the causal diagram using structural equation modeling and example data from a published study of meadows in Finland. Formal analysis rejects the literal translation of the HBM and reveals additional processes at work. This exercise shows how the practice of abstracting systems as causal networks (1) clarifies possible hypotheses, (2) permits explicit testing, and (3) provides more powerful and useful predictions. 4. Building on the Finnish meadow example, we contrast the utility of bivariate plots compared to structural equation models for investigating underlying processes. Simulations illustrate the fallibility of bivariate analysis as a means of supporting one theory over another, while models based on causal networks can quantify the sensitivity of diversity patterns to both management and natural constraints. 5. A key piece of Pierce's critique of Adler et al.'s conclusions relies on upper boundary regression which he claims to reveal strong relationships between production and richness in Adler et al.'s original data. We demonstrate that this technique shows strong associations in purely random data and is invalid for Adler et al.'s data because it depends on a uniform data distribution. We instead perform quantile regression on both the site-level summaries of the data and the plot-level data (using mixed- model quantile regression). Using a variety of nonlinear curve-fitting approaches, we were unable to detect a significant humped-shape boundary in the Adler et al. data. We reiterate that the bivariate productivity-richness relationships in Adler et al.'s data are weak and variable. 6. We urge ecologists to consider productivity-richness relationships through the lens of causal networks to advance our understanding beyond bivariate analysis. Further, we emphasize that models based on a causal network conceptualization can also provide more meaningful guidance for conservation management than can a bivariate perspective. Measuring only two variables does not permit the evaluation of complex ideas nor resolve debates about underlying mechanisms.},

The same attributes that result in an insect herbivore being termed a "pest" predispose it to disruption by climate change, particularly global warming. Although many pest species have co-evolved relationships with forest hosts that may or may not be harmful over the long term, the effects on these relationships may have disastrous consequences. We consider both the data and models necessary to evaluate the impacts of climate change, as well as the assessments that have been made to date. The results indicate that all aspects of insect outbreak behavior will intensify as the climate warms. This reinforces the need for more detailed monitoring and evaluations as climatic events unfold. Luckily, we are well placed to make rapid progress, using software tools, databases, and the models that are already available.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that the ability of an organism to move through a landscape is determined by the interaction between its movement behaviour and the landscape structure. In contrast, models predicting spatial distribution, local population stability, or metapopulation stability typically assume that movement ability is independent of landscape structure. These model predictions will be invalid if the assumption of constant movement ability is incorrect. To assess the influence of landscape structure on movement behaviour (and therefore movement ability), we tracked individual goldenrod beetles (Trirhabda borealis) through microlandscapes composed of three patch types (goldenrod, cut vegetation, and cut vegetation containing camouflage netting to a height of 50 cm) that differed in terms of available food resources and structural complexity. In goldenrod patches, beetles moved infrequently in brief bursts of slow meandering movements. In cut patches, beetles moved frequently in sustained bursts of slow directed movements. In netting patches, beetles moved frequently in brief bursts of fast meandering movements. Using mark-release experiments, we determined that T. borealis did not detect goldenrod from afar or respond to edge type. Since T. borealis movement behaviour differed between patch types, its movement ability must depend on landscape structure. If this general result applies to other species, it implies that predictions of local population and metapopulation responses to landscape alteration could be erroneous. Effects of landscape alteration on movement behaviour should be incorporated into models of population response to landscape alteration.},

abstract = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.},

abstract = {Effects of various single and two species diets on the performance of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) were studied when this insect was reared from hatch to pupation on intact host trees in the field. The tree species used for this study were red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white oak (Q. alba L.), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michaux), and trembling aspen (P. tremuloides Michaux). These are commonly available host trees in the Lake States region. The study spanned two years and was performed at two different field sites in central Michigan. Conclusions drawn from this study include: (1) Large differences in gypsy moth growth and survival can occur even among diet sequences composed of favorable host species. (2) Larvae that spent their first two weeks feeding on red oak performed better during this time period than larvae on all other host species in terms of mean weight, mean relative growth rate (RGR), and mean level of larval development, while larvae on a first host of bigtooth aspen were ranked lowest in terms of mean weight, RGR, and level of larval development. (3) Combination diets do not seem to be inherently better or worse than diets composed of only a single species; rather, insect performance was affected by the types of host species eaten and the time during larval development that these host species were consumed instead of whether larvae ate single species diets or mixed species diets. (4) In diets composed of two host species, measures of gypsy moth performance are affected to different extents in the latter part of the season by the two different hosts; larval weights and development rates show continued effects of the first host fed upon while RGRs, mortality, and pupal weights are affected strongly by the second host type eaten. (5) Of the diets investigated in this study, early feeding on red oak followed by later feeding on an aspen, particularly trembling aspen, is most beneficial to insects in terms of attaining high levels of performance throughout their lives.},

abstract = {This paper develops a procedure for quantify-ing movement sequences in terms of move length and turning angle probability distributions. By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displace-ment formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Obser-vations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circum-stances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these ex-amples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes. 1969). Alternatively, much progress has also been made by describing movement with analytical models that rely on the assumption of random motion (see especially, the pioneering work of Broadbent and Kendall 1953; Skellam 1951). In this paper, we extend an earlier formula concerning discrete random walks (see appendix of Jones 1977) and develop an analytic expression for net displace-ment in a correlated random walk. The formula that we develop fills a gap somewhere between the powerful general diffusion models of Skellam (1951) and the realistic detailed simulations of Jones (1977). One of the advantages of our approach is that it produces a summary of behavior that enables compari-sons to be made between different organisms, or for the same organism in different situations. In particular, by making the assumption of correlated random movement, we derive a formula for expected net displacement in terms of easily observed distance and directionality parameters. This formula can serve as a means for exploring the consequences of varying rules of movement. We illustrate the approach by applying it to two examples of insect movement.},

This is " Weisburd's paradox " and has been attributed by Weisburd, Petrosino, and Mason (1993) to a difficulty in maintaining quality control as studies get larger, and attributed by Nelson, Wooditch, and Dario (2014) to a negative correlation between sample sizes and the underlying sizes of the effects being measured. We argue against the necessity of both these explanations, instead suggesting that the apparent Weisburd paradox might be explainable as an artifact of systematic overestimation inherent in post-hoc power calculations, a bias that is large with small N . Speaking more generally, we recommend abandoning the use of statistical power as a measure of the strength of a study, because implicit in the definition of power is the bad idea of statistical significance as a research goal.},

abstract = {Field pupal weight, development time, and survival of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), larvae on three defoliated (50{\%}) and undefoliated tree species that are common to the forest of the Great Lakes basin were compared for one season in 1988. Host species and defoliation affected female pupal weight; male pupal weight was affected only by host species. The smallest and largest pupae of both sexes, from both defoliated and undefoliated trees, came from larvae that fed on red oak, Quercus rubra L., and trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx., respectively; pupal weight of larvae that fed on white birch, Betula papyrifera Marsh., were intermediate. Development time was affected only by tree species; the shortest and longest development occurred on trembling aspen and red oak, respectively; development time on white birch was medial. Gypsy moth survival was not affected by defoliation or host species. Superficially, these data obviously suggest that both defoliated and undefoliated trembling aspen and white birch are more nutritious, and will support higher gypsy moth fitness than its traditional hosts like red oak. However, we argue that outbreaks of gypsy moth will not occur in aspen and birch stands because its tri-trophic fitness is lower there due in part to the higher efficacy of certain gypsy moth natural enemies. We hypothesize that outbreaks on these two tree species will be limited by the nuclear polyhedrosis virus, Entomophagus maimaiga, and key physical features (e.g. light trunk color) of the host that deter larval host-seeking/accepting behavior. More than 20 years of gypsy moth outbreak records in North America support this hypothesis. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The seasonal development of physiological features underlying gradual acquisition of relatively high cold tolerance in overwintering adults of the bark beetles, Pityogenes chalcographus was described. Prior to overwintering, the beetles accumulated carbohydrate reserves in the form of glycogen and trehalose. These reserves were partially converted to glycerol during peaking winter so that glycerol concentration reached 1.4. M in average, which corresponds to approximately one quarter of the beetle dry mass. Whole body supercooling points decreased from -12.8. ??C in average at the beginning of dormancy (August) to -26.3. ??C in average during peaking winter (January). More than 75{\%} of January-collected beetles survived at -5. ??C for 30. days, at -15. ??C for 60. days and more than 40{\%} of them survived at -26. ??C for 12. h. High resistance against inoculation of body fluids with external ice crystals, and low mortality, was observed when January-collected beetles were encased in an ice block for 14. days. Thus, the physiological limits of cold tolerance measured at individual level in laboratory were safely sufficient for survival of P. chalcographus at any conceivable cold spell that may occur in Central Europe. In contrast, the field experiment showed that winter survival fluctuated between 23.8{\%} and 69.2{\%} at a population level depending on microclimatic conditions in different altitudes and overwintering locations (standing tree trunk or ground level). The meaning of laboratory-assessed physiological limits of cold tolerance for predictions of population winter survival in the field is discussed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to relate defoliation by the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), to components of the landscape in order to elucidate processes operating at the regional scale. Aerial sketch maps of gypsy moth-caused defoliation in Pennsylvania from 1969-1989 were assembled in a raster-based geographical information system (GIS). These images were manipulated using Boolean algebra to determine the total defoliation frequency for each 2 X 2 km grid cell over the 21-yr study period. Because the gypsy moth became established in different parts of Pennsylvania at different times, the defoliation frequency for each cell was corrected by dividing the raw frequency by the total number of years at risk to defoliation. The number of years at risk to defoliation was calculated as the number of years each area was considered within the generally infested area minus a constant lag term, to correct for the period in years between first designation of quarantine until first defoliation. For Pennsylvania the lag was estimated as 5 yr. Average defoliation frequencies were calculated for each of six major forest type groups occurring in Pennsylvania. Pine, oak-pine, and oak-hickory type groups were the most susceptible to defoliation; maple-birch-beech, aspen-birch, and nonforest-type groups were the least susceptible. The high defoliation frequency in pine types reflects heavy feeding on oaks in these areas since gypsy moth larvae rarely feed on most pine species. Forest type group areas were further cross-tabulated by elevation classes. The three most susceptible forest type groups exhibited decreased susceptibility at elevations lower than 200 m},

abstract = {When gypsy moth, Porthetria dispar (L.), egg-mass density was low (less than 50 egg masses/acre), density was 10 times higher along the forest edge than within the forest. Man-made objects (MMOs) left along the forest edge in suburban areas contained ca. ½ of the egg masses found at low densities. MMOs that were rough, or dry, or protected from light contained more egg masses than those that were smooth, or frequently moist, or exposed to light. Rough, dry MMOs that were protected from light contained the most egg masses. Apparently, these latter MMOs function as “bark flap” equivalents by providing a degree of protection for the growing larvae and pupae. It is postulated that sparse gypsy moth populations may tend to increase numerically from innocuous levels in situations where abundant larval resting and pupation locations other than the litter are available for the growing insects. Thus, littering the forest edge with MMOs could be a “triggering mechanism” for subsequent gypsy moth outbreaks.},

abstract = {The effects of long-term mass rearing of laboratory insects on ecologically relevant traits is an important consideration when applying research conclusions to wild populations or developing management strategies. Laboratory strains of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), an invasive forest pest in North America, have been continuously reared since 1967. Selection on these strains has enhanced a variety of traits, resulting in faster development, shorter diapause, and greater fecundity. As in many mass-reared insects, laboratory strains of the gypsy moth are also reared exclusively on artificial diets that lack much of the phytochemical and nutritional complexity associated with natural foliage.We tested for differences in growth and development of wild gypsy moth populations from across the invasive range in comparison to laboratory strains when reared on artificial diet and a preferred foliage host species, northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Overall, caterpillars reared on foliage had higher survival and faster development rates, with smaller differences among populations. When reared on artificial diet, laboratory strains had the highest performance as expected. The response from the wild populations was mixed, with two populations performing poorly on artificial diet and another performing nearly as well as the laboratory strains. Performance on diet was enhanced when larvae received cubed portions changed regularly, as opposed to filled cups. Understanding these relationships between food source and population performance is important for informing studies that examine population comparisons using wild and laboratory- reared strains.},

abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-{\$}t{\$} prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-{\$}t{\$} prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

abstract = {Axis formation is a key step in development, but studies indicate that genes involved in insect axis formation are relatively fast evolving. Orthodenticle genes have conserved roles, often with hunchback, in maternal anterior patterning in several insect species. We show that two orthodenticle genes, otd1 and otd2, and hunchback act as maternal anterior patterning genes in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) but, unlike other insects, act to pattern the majority of the anteroposterior axis. These genes regulate the expression domains of anterior, central and posterior gap genes and may directly regulate the anterior gap gene giant. We show otd1 and hunchback also influence dorsoventral patterning by regulating zerkn{\"{u}}lt (zen) as they do in Tribolium, but that zen does not regulate the expression of honeybee gap genes. This suggests that interactions between anteroposterior and dorsal-ventral patterning are ancestral in holometabolous insects. Honeybee axis formation, and the function of the conserved anterior patterning gene orthodenticle, displays unique characters that indicate that, even when conserved genes pattern the axis, their regulatory interactions differ within orders of insects, consistent with relatively fast evolution in axis formation pathways.},

abstract = {Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), larvae reared on leaves of various tree species differed in survival, development rate, and fecundity. White oak and red oak generally produced greatest survival, most rapid development, heaviest pupae, and highest fecundity. White ash caused 100{\%} mortality. Beech, red maple, sugar maple, and Eastern hemlock were intermediate in their effects. Rearing larvae on leaves obtained from trees 1 or 2 mo after the normal hatch date increased mortality to 95–100{\%} on all diets except white oak; on white oak, fecundity of survivors dropped to ca. half its value on young leaves. Leaves of all 7 tree species declined in water and nitrogen content and increased in toughness between early May and late June, which may explain partly the decreased survival of larvae fed on more mature leaves. In preference tests, newly emerged 1st-instar larvae chose white oak over red oak, but chose the latter over most other species. The adverse effects of feeding on non-oak host leaves may mean that as the proportion of oaks declines in an area, the gypsy moth population will also decline. This could explain the observation that the most severe gypsy moth outbreaks occur in areas where the insect is newly introduced and favorable host species are abundant.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Determining the strengths of interactions among species in natural com-munities presents a major challenge to ecology. Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among other unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and Mytilus abundance because of space competition; (c) Mytilus reduces Semibalanus cover through competition for space; and (d) as prey species, Semibalanus and Pollicipes enhance Nucella density, but Nucella pre-dation does not have important effects on Semibalanus or Pollicipes. Based on the estimated strength of direct interactions, the importance of indirect effects among species could also be predicted. In experiments manipulating Nucella, Pollicipes, Semibalanus, and birds independently of one another, I tested 11 of the interactions predicted by the path analysis; all were supported. Path analysis in conjunction with limited experiments may provide an efficient means to predict important direct and indirect interactions among unmanipulated species within ecological communities.},

The 2h-long warm pulses, however, were not sufficient for accumulation of PaHSP70 protein and thus no significant difference in expression of PaHSP70 protein was detected between FTR and CLT regimes.

Host-plant abundance has been shown to affect the range expansion of invasive pests, but the effect of landscape diversity (i.e. density of host/non-host patches and diversity of forest habitat patches) on invasions remains largely untested. We used boundary displacement models and boosted regression tree analyses to investigate the effects of landscape diversity on the invasion of Corsica by the maritime pine bast scale Matsucoccus feytaudi over an 18-yr period. Taking the passive wind dispersal of the scale into account, we showed that open habitats and connectivity between host patches accelerated spread by up to 13{\%}, whereas landscapes with high tree diversity and a high density of non-host trees decreased scale spread by up to 14{\%}. We suggest a new mechanism for such associational resistance to pest invasion at the landscape level, which we term ‘the pitfall effect'.},

abstract = {Visual observation enables a good understanding of beneficial insect behaviour within a locality, but once the rapidly dispersing beneficial insects walk or fly, they are soon lost from view. The harmonic radar tracking system developed to follow Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata in flight is proposed as a useful technique to increase the study range of beneficial insects from that of the plant to that of the landscape. These insects belong to a wide array of orders and families and many are small in size. Nevertheless, we estimated that some 15{\%} of beneficial insects are at least similar in length to the chrysomelid beetle for which the feasibility of using a portable harmonic radar has been successfully demonstrated. As for the Colorado beetle, the pulsed radar transmitter, the tag, the antenna gain and the receiver of the portable radar system must be carefully designed to provide both a sufficient tracking range and a sufficient beam width. The construction of the tag is strongly limited by the load-carrying ability of the beneficial insect to be tracked. For the tracking of normal insect dispersal tags must, by definition, be lighter than the maximum carrying ability for extra loads and within the wing loading range of each species. It has been shown that in herbivorous insects and mosquitoes the ability to fly may be traded against the opportunity to acquire a large meal. This trade-off, which limits the ability of the insects to carry extra loads, should be less likely to occur with beneficial species that have to remain highly mobile to locate and capture prey for example. This was supported by our findings for Hippodamia convergens and Harmonia axyridis (Coccinellidae), both of which retain their ability to fly over the full range of their wing loading values. Tests conducted in the laboratory showed that these two beneficial insects can display normal flight behaviour with tags representing a similar percentage of their body mass as those successfully developed for the Colorado beetle and only slightly higher than for the other ones reported in the literature. The application of the portable harmonic radar technology to the study of flight by beneficial insects is therefore feasible and worth developing further. The main challenge is in the development of electronic tags with a sufficiently small absolute mass. Many options available immediately and others with potential are discussed},

abstract = {Range expansions are a function of population growth and dispersal, and nascent populations often must overcome demographic Allee effects (positive density dependence at low population densities) driven by factors such as mate-finding failure. Given the importance of individual movement to mate finding, links between landscape structure and movement may be critical to range expansion; however, landscape effects on other factors including mortality may be equally or more important. In one of the most comprehensive investigations of the interactions of these processes to date, we combined field experiments, simulation modeling, and analysis of empirical spread patterns to investigate how landscape structure affected the spread of the gypsy moth in Virginia and West Virginia. In experiments designed to assess how landscape attributes affect mate finding, we found adult males resisted leaving forest patches and the probability of locating a pheromone source declined more rapidly over distance in non-forest matrix than in forest. We used these findings to develop individual-based simulation models of gypsy moth population dynamics and spread in complex patch-matrix landscapes. The models produced an Allee effect that strengthened with reductions in forested area, but owing more so to dispersal mortality than to effects on mate location. Predicted maximum rates of population spread grew with increases in forest area due to increasing success of long-distance transport events. Evaluations of empirical data showed relationships between spread rates and landscape structure largely consistent with model predictions. We conclude rates of spread were largely driven by long-distance dispersal events, the success of which was influenced primarily by dispersal mortality of larvae in unsuitable matrix, and that landscape effects on mate location played a secondary role. Though influences of landscape structure on mate location appear to be unimportant to the spread of the gypsy moth, we predict they would have stronger effects on more dispersive species.},

abstract = {In many parts of North America, ash (Fraxinus) stands have been reduced by the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) invasion to a few surviving mature trees, saplings, basal sprouts, and seedlings. Without a soil seed bank for Fraxinus spp., tree recovery will require survival and maturation of these younger cohorts to reproductive age. Here we report and analyze the population dynamics of emerald ash borer and its associated natural enemies in ash saplings (2.5–5.8cmDBH) in six deciduous forest stands in southern Michigan. At these sites, the outbreak population of the pest collapsed during the study, and a biocontrol agent introduced from China, the larval parasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi, became widely established and increased in rates of parasitism. To assess the potential for ash recovery in these stands, we also quantified the abundance and crown condition of the ash saplings and surviving ash trees at the study sites. We found that T. planipennisi was the dominant biotic mortality factor in saplings, killing 36–85{\%} of the late instar borer larvae. Neither woodpecker predation nor native parasitoids caused more than minor levels ({\textless}20{\%}) of borer mortality in saplings. Life table analyses of these data further showed that the net population growth rate of the pest in saplings was near or under replacement levels, and that the introduced biocontrol agent reduced the pest's net population growth rate in saplings at our study sites by over 50{\%}. In addition, stand inventories found that healthy ash saplings (4–16 per 100m2) and smaller (pole size) trees (2–9 per 100m2) remained in the six study sites, despite an early high density population of the pest at the sites. These findings indicate that the introduced biocontrol agent T. planipennisi is providing significant biocontrol services, enhancing ash survival and promoting recovery of the ash in southern Michigan.},

However, concentration-response relationships with causal agents have only been established occasionally and with varying success, In this laboratory study, instar II and III larvae were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of lead, mercury and ??-sitosterol. A significant deformation response was induced in the pecten with lead and mercury. Deformation frequencies of the mentum after metal exposures were not significantly different from the control. Moulting was retarded by both metals and was well correlated with mouthpart deformation. The ??-sitosterol is an endocrine disruptor, which was used to test the hypothetical cause-effect relation between disruption of ecdyson functioning and chironomid deformation. In the present study, exposure to sublethal concentrations of ??-sitosterol did not result in any effect on deformation or moulting. As such, the proposed hypothesis of endocrine disruptors as primary casual agents of chironomid deformation could not be substantiated. Acetone, which was used as a solvent to apply ??-sitosterol caused a significant increase of mentum deformation. The ground filtration paper used as substrate seemed to induce deformities as well. Substrate contamination, acetone and (especially) inbreeding were most probably responsible for the high deformation frequencies in the control conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Insects are able to see ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Nocturnal insects are often attracted to light sources that emit large amounts of UV radiation, and devices that exploit this behavior, such as light traps for forecasting pest outbreaks, and electric insect killers, have been developed. Some diurnal species are attracted to yellow; yellow pan traps are used for conducting surveys for pest outbreaks and yellow sticky plates are used for pest control. Lamps that give off yellow illumination have been used effectively to control the activity of nocturnal moths and thus reduce damage to fruit, vegetables, and flowers. Covering cultivation facilities with film that filters out near-UV radiation reduces the invasion of pests such as whiteflies and thrips into the facilities, thus reducing damage. Reflective material placed on cultivated land can control the approach of flying insects such as aphids. Future development and use of new light sources such as light-emitting diodes is anticipated for promoting integrated pest management.},

abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.},

abstract = {The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) is often motivated by its utility for investigating complex networks of relationships, but also because of its promise as a means of representing theoretical concepts using latent variables. In this paper, we discuss characteristics of ecological theory and some of the challenges for proper specification of theoretical ideas in structural equation models (SE models). In our presentation, we describe some of the requirements for classical latent variable models in which observed variables (indicators) are interpreted as the effects of underlying causes. We also describe alternative model specifications in which indicators are interpreted as having causal influences on the theoretical concepts. We suggest that this latter nonclassical specification (which involves another variable type—the composite) will often be appropriate for ecological studies because of the multifaceted nature of our theoretical concepts. In this paper, we employ the use of meta-models to aid the translation of theory into SE models and also to facilitate our ability to relate results back to our theories. We demonstrate our approach by showing how a synthetic theory of grassland biodiversity can be evaluated using SEM and data from a coastal grassland. In this example, the theory focuses on the responses of species richness to abiotic stress and disturbance, both directly and through intervening effects on community biomass. Models examined include both those based on classical forms (where each concept is represented using a single latent variable) and also ones in which the concepts are recognized to be multifaceted and modeled as such. To address the challenge of matching SE models with the conceptual level of our theory, two approaches are illustrated, compositing and aggregation. Both approaches are shown to have merits, with the former being preferable for cases where the multiple facets of a concept have widely differing effects in the system and the latter being preferable where facets act together consistently when influencing other parts of the system. Because ecological theory characteristically deals with concepts that are multifaceted, we expect the methods presented in this paper will be useful for ecologists wishing to use SEM.},

abstract = {The dispersal patterns of animals are important in metapopulation ecology because they affect the dynamics and survival of populations. Theoretical models assume random dispersal but little is known in practice about the dispersal behaviour of individual animals or the strategy by which dispersers locate distant habitat patches. In the present study, we released individual meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina) in a non-habitat and investigated their ability to return to a suitable habitat. The results provided three reasons for supposing that meadow brown butterflies do not seek habitat by means of random flight. First, when released within the range of their normal dispersal distances, the butterflies orientated towards suitable habitat at a higher rate than expected at random. Second, when released at larger distances from their habitat, they used a non-random, systematic, search strategy in which they flew in loops around the release point and returned periodically to it. Third, butterflies returned to a familiar habitat patch rather than a non-familiar one when given a choice. If dispersers actively orientate towards or search systematically for distant habitat, this may be problematic for existing metapopulation models, including models of the evolution of dispersal rates in metapopulations.},

abstract = {A review of insect adaptations for resistance to cold and for life-cycle timing reveals the complexity of the adaptations and their relationships to features of the environment. Cold hardiness is a complex and dynamic state that differs widely among species. Surviving cold depends on habitat choice, relationships with ice and water, and synthesis of a variety of cryoprotectant molecules. Many aspects are time-dependent and are integrated with other factors such as taxonomic affinity, resource availability, natural enemies, and diapause. Timing adaptations reflect the fact that all environments change over many different time frames, from days to thousands of years. Environments differ in severity and in the extent, nature, variability, and predictability of change, as well as in how reliably cues indicate probable conditions in the future. These differences are reflected by a wide range of insect life-cycle systems, life-cycle delays, levels of responsiveness to various environmental signals, genetic systems, and circadian responses. In particular, the degree of environmental change, its predictability on different time frames, and whether it can be monitored effectively dictate the balance between fixed and flexible timing responses. These same environmental features have to be characterized to understand cold hardiness, but this has not yet been done. Therefore, the following key questions must be answered in order to put cold hardiness into the necessary ecological context: How much do conditions change? How consistent is the change? How reliable are environmental signals?},

Path segmentation methods provide basics for detecting movement changes and the behavioral mechanisms driving them. However, available path segmentation methods differ vastly with respect to underlying statistical assumptions and output produced. Consequently, it is currently difficult for researchers new to path segmentation to gain an overview of the different methods, and choose one that is appropriate for their data and research questions. Here, we provide an overview of different methods for segmenting movement paths according to potential changes in underlying behavior. To structure our overview, we outline three broad types of research questions that are commonly addressed through path segmentation: 1) the quantitative description of movement patterns, 2) the detection of significant change-points, and 3) the identification of underlying processes or ‘hidden states'. We discuss advantages and limitations of different approaches for addressing these research questions using path-level movement data, and present general guidelines for choosing methods based on data characteristics and questions. Our overview illustrates the large diversity of available path segmentation approaches, highlights the need for studies that compare the utility of different methods, and identifies opportunities for future developments in path-level data analysis.},

Tabanids at stations separated by four different distances (5, 10, 25, and 50 m) were marked. In the first study, tabanids were marked and allowed to feed until engorgement or natural interruption occurred and captured if they transferred to the other horse. A total of 2847 tabanids belonging to nine different species were marked. The percentage of tabanids that moved between horses was 10.5 at 5 m, 6.8 at 10 m, and 4.6 at 25 m. In the second study, flies were marked, feeding was then interrupted, and the flies were released approximately 50 cm from the host. A total of 1274 tabanids belonging to five different species were marked. The percentage of flies that moved between horses was 9.7 at 5 m, 9.7 at 10 m, and 4.6 at 25 m. No tabanids transferred between animals separated by 50 m in either experiment.

abstract = {Although habitat loss, fragmentation, and invasive species collectively pose the greatest threats to biodiversity, little theoretical or empirical research has addressed the effects of landscape structure—or spa-tial pattern more generally—on the spread of invasive species. Landscape ecology is the study of how spatial pattern affects ecological process. Thus, a landscape ecology of invasive spread involves understanding how spatial pattern, such as habitat fragmentation or resource distributions, affects the various stages of the in-vasion process. Landscape structure may affect the spread of invasive species and the invasibility of commu-nities by (1) enhancing spread above some threshold level of landscape disturbance directly, or indirectly through landscape effects on dispersal vectors; (2) affecting the various stages of the invasion process (e.g., dispersal vs. population growth) in different, potentially contrasting, ways; (3) interacting with the distribu-tion of invasive species to facilitate spread (e.g., nascent foci); (4) promoting or altering species interactions in ways that enhance the invasibility of communities (e.g., edge effects); (5) compromising the adaptive po-tential of native species to resist invasion, or—alternatively—enhancing the adaptive response of invasive species, in fragmented landscapes; and (6) interacting with the dynamics of the disturbance architecture to create spatiotemporal fluctuations in resource availability, which enhance system invasibility. Understand-ing the landscape ecology of invasive spread may thus afford new insights and opportunities for managing and restoring landscapes so as to control the spread of invasive species and minimize the invasibility of communities.

abstract = {The Mormon cricket, Anabrus simplex (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), is a flightless katydid that undergoes major outbreaks in western North America. Under outbreak conditions, Mormon crickets often form large cohesive migratory bands that can contain millions of individuals moving in unison across the landscape. Density-dependent phase polyphenism has been hypothesized as a behavioural mechanism underlying Mormon cricket band formation and movement based largely on the similarity between bands of Mormon crickets and those of migratory locusts. I tested this hypothesis by quantifying the effects of long-term differences in rearing density versus the short-term presence or absence of conspecifics on Mormon cricket movement behaviour across three different developmental stages. Rearing density and the presence of conspecifics both influenced Mormon cricket movement, but in distinctly different ways. Increases in the expression of walking-related behaviours were mainly induced by the short-term presence of conspecifics. The longer-term effects of high rearing density primarily influenced only turning-related behaviours. Developmental variation in activity levels was observed and indicates that developmental stage should be an important consideration in future analyses of Mormon cricket movement. Overall, these results suggest that interindividual interactions play a greater role in inducing the movement of migratory band-forming Mormon crickets than do endogenous behavioural-phase changes mediated by high local rearing density. ?? 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America. All rights reserved. Periodic introductions of the Asian subspecies of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar asiatica Vnukovskij and Lymantria dispar japonica Motschulsky, in North America are threatening forests and interrupting foreign trade. Although Asian gypsy moth has similar morphology to that of European and North American gypsy moth, it has several traits that make it a greater threat, the most important being the flight capability of females. Asian gypsy moth is not yet established in North America; however, infestations have been detected multiple times in Canada and the United States. To facilitate detection and eradication efforts, we evaluated the effect of a range of temperatures on development time, survivorship, and fertility of eight populations of Asian gypsy moth. There were significant impacts of temperature and population on these life history characteristics. The larval developmental rate increased with temperature until it reached an optimum at 29 °C. Larvae experienced significant molting problems at the highest and lowest temperatures tested (10 °C and 30 °C). At 30 °C, female fitness was markedly compromised, as evidenced by reduced fecundity and fertility. This suggests that development and survival of Asian gypsy moth may be limited by summer temperature extremes in the Southern United States. We also determined the degree-day requirements for two critical life stages and two populations of Asian gypsy moth, which represent the extremes in latitude, to predict the timing for biopesticide application and adult trap deployment. Our data will benefit pest managers in developing management strategies, pest risk assessments, and timing for implementation of management tactics.},

abstract = {Climatic changes are predicted to significantly affect the frequency and severity of disturbances that shape forest ecosystems. We provide a synthesis of climate change effects on native bark beetles, important mortality agents of conifers in western North America. Because of differences in temperature-dependent life-history strategies, including cold-induced mortality and developmental timing, responses to warming will differ among and within bark beetle species. The success of bark beetle populations will also be influenced indirectly by the effects of climate on community associates and host-tree vigor, although little information is available to quantify these relationships. We used available population models and climate forecasts to explore the responses of two eruptive bark beetle species. Based on projected warming, increases in thermal regimes conducive to population success are predicted for Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby) and Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, although there is considerable spatial and temporal variability. These predictions from population models suggest a movement of temperature suitability to higher latitudes and elevations and identify regions with a high potential for bark beetle outbreaks and associated tree mortality in the coming century.},

According to the oviposition-preference-offspring-performance hypothesis, oviposition-preference hierarchy should correspond to host suitability for offspring development because females maximize their fitness by optimizing offspring performance. We show, we believe for the first time, that adult feeding site and related adult performance may explain most of the variation in adult feeding and oviposition site selection of an oligophagous grass miner, Chromatomyia nigra (Diptera). This study advances our understanding of the complex interactions between plants and herbivores because it shows that host-preference patterns are not only shaped by the optimization of offspring performance, as previously assumed, but also by the optimization of adult performance.},

abstract = {Sightability models are binary logistic-regression models used to estimate and adjust for visibility bias in wildlife-population surveys. Like many models in wildlife and ecology, sightability models are typically developed from small observational datasets with many candidate predictors. Aggressive model-selection methods are often employed to choose a best model for prediction and effect estimation, despite evidence that such methods can lead to overfitting (i.e., selected models may describe random error or noise rather than true predictor–response curves) and poor predictive ability. We used moose (Alces alces) sightability data from northeastern Minnesota (2005–2007) as a case study to illustrate an alternative approach, which we refer to as degrees-of-freedom (df) spending: sample-size guidelines are used to determine an acceptable level of model complexity and then a pre-specified model is fit to the data and used for inference. For comparison, we also constructed sightability models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) step-down procedures and model averaging (based on a small set of models developed using df-spending guidelines). We used bootstrap procedures to mimic the process of model fitting and prediction, and to compute an index of overfitting, expected predictive accuracy, and model-selection uncertainty. The index of overfitting increased 13$\backslash${\%} when the number of candidate predictors was increased from three to eight and a best model was selected using step-down procedures. Likewise, model-selection uncertainty increased when the number of candidate predictors increased. Model averaging (based on R = 30 models with 1–3 predictors) effectively shrunk regression coefficients toward zero and produced similar estimates of precision to our 3-df pre-specified model. As such, model averaging may help to guard against overfitting when too many predictors are considered (relative to available sample size). The set of candidate models will influence the extent to which coefficients are shrunk toward zero, which has implications for how one might apply model averaging to problems traditionally approached using variable-selection methods. We often recommend the df-spending approach in our consulting work because it is easy to implement and it naturally forces investigators to think carefully about their models and predictors. Nonetheless, similar concepts should apply whether one is fitting 1 model or using multi-model inference. For example, model-building decisions should consider the effective sample size, and potential predictors should be screened (without looking at their relationship to the response) for missing data, narrow distributions, collinearity, potentially overly influential observations, and measurement errors (e.g., via logical error checks).},

abstract = {Arthropods, as poikilotherms, adapt to cold environments in a variety of ways that include extension of locomotory activity to low temperatures, enhancement of metabolic rate and maintenance of a positive energy balance whenever possible. The ecological implications for many such animals are extension of the life cycle and a requirement for an individual to overwinter several times. Prolonged sub-zero temperatures increase the risk of tissue freezing, and two main strategies have been evolved, first avoidance of freezing by supercooling, and secondly, tolerance of extracellular ice. In the first strategy, freezing is invariably lethal and extensive supercooling (to -30 {\textless}latex{\textgreater}{\$}{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}{\textless}/latex{\textgreater}C and below) occurs through elimination or masking of potential ice nucleators in the body and accumulation of cryoprotective substances such as polyhydric alcohols and sugars. Such species are termed freezing intolerant. The second strategy, freezing tolerance, is uncommon in arthropods and other invertebrates, and usually occurs in a single life stage of a species. Freezing of liquid in the extracellular compartment is promoted by proteinaceous ice nucleators. Freezing is therefore protective, and the lethal temperature is well below the supercooling point in freezing tolerant individuals, whereas in most freezing intolerant species it is close to or at the supercooling point. Proteins also act as antifreezes in insects of both strategies, producing a thermal hysteresis by lowering the freezing point of haemolymph in a non-colligative fashion while not affecting the melting point temperature. Recent studies and developments in arthropod cold tolerance are discussed against this background, and a broader approach than hitherto is advocated, which integrates ecological information with physiological data.},

A prime example is the invasion of the gypsy moth in the United States, for which more than {\$}194 million was spent on management and monitoring between 1985 and 2004 alone. The spread of the gypsy moth across eastern North America is, perhaps, the most thoroughly studied biological invasion in the world, providing a unique opportunity to explore spatiotemporal variability in rates of spread. Here we describe evidence for periodic pulsed invasions, defined as regularly punctuated range expansions interspersed among periods of range stasis. We use a theoretical model with parameter values estimated from long-term monitoring data to show how an interaction between strong Allee effects (negative population growth at low densities) and stratified diffusion (most individuals disperse locally, but a few seed new colonies by long-range movement) can explain the invasion pulses. Our results indicate that suppressing population peaks along range borders might greatly slow invasion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence--with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies--is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices--automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables--are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

abstract = {The tropical root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus is a major pest of multiple crops in the Caribbean Islands and has become a serious constraint to citrus production in the United States. Recent work has identified host and conspecific volatiles that mediate host- and mate-finding by D. abbreviatus. The interaction of light, color, and odors has not been studied in this species. The responses of male and female D. abbreviatus to narrow bandwidths of visible light emitted by LEDs offered alone and in combination with olfactory stimuli were studied in a specially-designed multiple choice arena combined with a locomotion compensator. Weevils were more attracted to wavelengths close to green and yellow compared with blue or ultraviolet, but preferred red and darkness over green. Additionally, dim green light was preferred over brighter green. Adult weevils were also attracted to the odor of its citrus host + conspecifics. However, the attractiveness of citrus + conspecific odors disappeared in the presence of a green light. Photic stimulation induced males but not females to increase their speed. In the presence of light emitted by LEDs, turning speed decreased and path straightness increased, indicating that weevils tended to walk less tortuously. Diaprepes abbreviatus showed a hierarchy between chemo- and photo-taxis in the series of experiments presented herein, where the presence of the green light abolished upwind anemotaxis elicited by the pheromone + host plant odor. Insight into the strong responses to visual stimuli of chemically stimulated insects may be provided when the amount of information supplied by vision and olfaction is compared, as the information transmission capacity of compound eyes is estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher compared with the olfactory system. Subordination of olfactory responses by photic stimuli should be considered in the design of strategies aimed at management of such insects.},

Larvae were reared on one of four artificial diets, including a low wheat-germ control diet, and protein-, mineral- and vitamin-deficient diets. Growth of fourth instars was reduced on each nutrient-deficient diet; reductions were attributable to decreased efficiencies of conversion of digested food. Larvae on the low protein diet exhibited compensatory feeding responses, but not great enough to offset the reduction in protein intake. The low protein and low mineral diets prolonged development time of females, and reduced pupal weights of males and females. All larvae fed the low vitamin diet succumbed to a nuclear polyhedrosis virus late in the fifth larval stadium. We observed few significant effects and no clear-cut patterns of response of detoxication enzymes to nutrient limitation. Polysubstrate monooxygenase and glutathione transferase activities were unaffected. Soluble esterase and carbonyl reductase activities tended to increase in response to protein deficiency, but decrease in response to vitamin deficiency. Phytophagous insects evolutionarily adapted to feeding on nutrient-poor but allelochemical-rich host plants may have evolved biochemical/physiological mechanisms that serve to maintain effective enzyme function in the context of nutrient deficiency.},

This paper shows that (1) the efficiency of an oriented path can be reliably estimated by a straightness index computed as the ratio between the distance from the starting point to the goal and the path length travelled to reach the goal, but such a simple index, ranging between 0 and 1, cannot be applied to random search paths; (2) the tortuosity of a random search path, ranging between straight line movement and Brownian motion, can be reliably estimated by a sinuosity index which combines the mean cosine of changes of direction with the mean step length; and (3) in the current state of the art, the fractal analysis of animals' paths, which may appear as an alternative and promising way to measure the tortuosity of a random search path as a fractal dimension ranging between 1 (straight line movement) and 2 (Brownian motion), is only liable to generate artifactual results. This paper also provides some help for distinguishing between oriented and random search paths, and depicts a general, comprehensive framework for analysing individual animals' paths in a two-dimensional space. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {About 90{\%} of the gypsy moth, Porthetria dispar (L.) pupae found in a series of sparse stable populations studied between 1965 and 1968 were either beneath bark flaps or in the litter. Male larvae were more likely to pupate in bark flaps than females. Pupal survival was usually higher among pupae beneath bark flaps than among those in the litter, and bark flaps provided virtually the only pupation locations in the whole environment, within the highest density stratum studied, where female pupae had a reasonable survival probability. Adult gypsy moth production in these populations could be accurately estimated from knowledge of pupal density and sex ratio, and the number of bark flaps per 0.01-acre. Bark flap removal is suggested as a potentially useful technique for preventing outbreaks.},

abstract = {Legged locomotion results from a combination of central pattern generating network (CPG) activity and intralimb and interlimb sensory feedback. Data on the neural basis of interlimb coordination are very limited. We investigated here the influence of stepping in one leg on the activities of neighboring-leg thorax-coxa (TC) joint CPGs in the stick insect (Carausius morosus). We used a new approach combining single-leg stepping with pharmacological activation of segmental CPGs, sensory stimulation, and additional stepping legs. Stepping of a single front leg could activate the ipsilateral mesothoracic TC CPG. Activation of the metathoracic TC CPG required that both ipsilateral front and middle legs were present and that one of these legs was stepping. Unlike the situation in real walking, ipsilateral mesothoracic and metathoracic TC CPGs activated by front-leg stepping fired in phase with the front-leg stepping. Local (intralimb) sensory feedback from load sensors could override this intersegmental influence of front-leg stepping, shifting retractor motoneuron activity relative to the front-leg step cycle and thereby uncoupling them from front-leg stepping. These data suggest that front-leg stepping in isolation would result in in-phase activity of all ipsilateral legs, and functional stepping gaits (in which the three ipsilateral legs do not step in synchrony) emerge because of local load sensory feedback overriding this in-phase influence.},

abstract = {Two strategies for controlling first-instar larvae of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L)), insecticidal bait and contact insecticide applied directly to the tree trunk, were evaluated in the laboratory. Spinosad was selected as a candidate natural-product insecticide that is active both by contact and ingestion. Incorporated into artificial diet-based bait, spinosad was toxic to neonate larvae with a minimal 10-s feeding period, with an LC50 value of 20 (15-26, 95{\%} confidence interval) mg liter-1. It was significant that neonate larvae did not discriminate between spinosad-treated and control diet. Efficacy of diet-based bait in the laboratory, however, was significantly impacted by previous exposure to diet; fed larvae did not stop at the bait and did not incur mortality, as compared to unfed larvae. Oak bark was a suitable substrate from which neonate larvae could contact spinosad residues. Spinosad applied directly to oak bark resulted in significant mortality after 1- and 4-min crawling contact exposure times (LC50 = 24 [20-29, 95{\%} CI] and 8.7 [6.9-11, 95{\%} CI] mg liter-1, respectively) and contact activity persisted for 2 weeks. While contact activity was more potent on glass surfaces than on oak bark, the LC50 values differed only by factors of 2.4 and 3.6, for 1- and 4-min exposures respectively.},

A field study of dispersal from a dense population indicates that dispersal occurs throughout most of the duration of stadium I. Records taken at regular intervals during the day show that most dispersal occurs in late morning and closely coincides with activity of larvae. During the night, at low temperatures, or in periods of rain, larvae are inactive and few are dislodged even by strong winds. The long duration of hatch makes it difficult to prevent dispersal and get sufficient kill by a single application of a short-residual insecticide.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Probability of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) establishment is used as a case study. A neural network facilitates the integration of variables representing dynamic anthropogenic interaction and ecological characteristics. Neural network model (back-propagation network [BPN]) results are compared to logistic regression and multi-criteria evaluation via weighted linear combination, using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and a simple threshold assessment. The BPN provided the most accurate infestation-forecast predictions producing an AUC of 0.93, followed by multi-criteria evaluation (AUC = 0.92) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.86) when independently validating using post model infestation data. Results suggest that BPN can provide valuable insight into factors contributing to introduction for invasive species whose propagation and establishment requirements are not fully understood. The integration of anthropogenic and ecological variables allowed production of an accurate risk model and provided insight into the impact of human activities. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The gypsy moth has been present in North America for more than 100 years, and in many of the areas where it has become established outbreaks occur with varying degrees of periodicity. There also exists extensive spatial synchrony in the onset of outbreaks over large geographic regions. Density-dependent mortality clearly limits high-density populations, but there is little evidence for strong regulation of low-density populations. Predation by small mammals appears to be the major source of mortality affecting low-density populations. but because these are generalist predators and gypsy moths are a less preferred food item, mammals do not appear to regulate populations in a density-dependent fashion. Instead, predation levels appear to be primarily determined by small mammal abundance, which is in turn closely linked to the production of acorns that are a major source of food for overwintering predator populations. Mast production by host oak trees is typically variable among years, but considerable spatial synchrony in masting exists over large geographic areas. Thus, it appears that the temporal and spatial patterns of mast production may be responsible for the episodic and spatially synchronous behavior of gypsy moth outbreaks in North America. This multitrophic relationship among mast, predators, and gypsy moths represents a very different explanation of forest insect outbreak dynamics than the more widely applied theories based upon predator-prey cycles or feedbacks with host foliage quality.},

abstract = {Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is rapidly invading North America and has inflicted extensive ash, Fraxinus spp., mortality in affected areas, altering composition and structure of wildland and urban forests. Insecticides can effectively protect ash on a small scale and classical biological control efforts have been implemented. In the U.S. emerald ash borer kills native ash so quickly, and populations are so mobile, that establishing an effective biological control program is challenging. Consequently, we assessed the compatibility of using reduced rates of the insecticide imidacloprid applied as a soil drench coupled with releases of three species of parasitic wasps. In this way we hope to slow the process of ash decline and prolong the window of opportunity to allow biological control agents to become established. We compared the efficacy and effects of i) full strength imidacloprid applications, ii) reduced rates of imidacloprid coupled with classical biological control, iii) classical biological control alone, and iv) untreated controls. We monitored emerald ash borer adult activity through trapping and destructive sampling for larvae, evaluated larval parasitization rates, and also assessed the native hymenopteran communities. Chemical treatments were not adequate to prevent ash canopy decline, but they also did not impede parasitization of emerald ash borer eggs or larvae. Two of the three classical biological control agents, Oobius agrili and Tetrastichus planipennisi, were recovered from trees treated with imidacloprid, demonstrating that they were successfully reproducing and indicating the compatibility of the two management strategies. Non-target hymenopterans appeared unaffected by the insecticide applications. Importantly we found no negative effects of the imidacloprid applications on native pollinators. Collectively these data suggest that judicious use of insecticides coupled with classical biological control may be an effective and potentially sustainable approach to managing invading populations of emerald ash borer.},

abstract = {Host-plant selection by phytophagous insects is largely determined by adult insects choosing the developmental location of offspring. Knowledge of natural selection leads to theoretical predictions about how adult behaviour might respond to host quality, the abundance of host-plants, adult egg-load, age and available search time, density-dependence, and stochastic effects. Debates about the value of simple adaptive models can only be settled by repeated testing and reformulation. The theoretical basis of adaptive host selection is quite strong, but several challenges remain. Models are lacking which are both general enough to be applicable to a wide rang of species, and easy to test. The role of variability in plant abundance and other stochastic forces requires clarification. Empirically, good field studies of the effect of host-plants on insect fitness are rare, but without them little progress can be made. The assessment of host-preference also requires attention. Quantitative tests of theory are rare, probably because general models do not encompass enough relevant natural history for each particular species. However much anecdotal and qualitative evidence seems to reflect adaptive predictions. A challenge for the future is to assess the adaptive value of particular mechanisms of host-selection, and to relate these to the predictions made in simple adaptive models.},

Yet the frequency and extent of phenological mismatches have not been quantified over forest landscapes. Forest dwelling, spring-feeding defoliators must synchronize larval emergence annually with leaf-out phenology of host trees. Lack of synchrony can limit population expansion, unless dispersing larvae successfully locate phenologically compatible hosts. We quantified the potential for successful dispersal of an introduced defoliator in a forest landscape by mapping phenological asynchrony from 2000 to 2010. Maps compared MODIS derived leaf-out with gypsy moth egg-hatch from the BioSIM insect phenology model. Mean temporal differences between gypsy moth egg-hatch and leaf-out were sufficient ({\textless}-5 or {\textgreater}+10. days) to severely limit 1st instar survival in 5 of 11. years. Biologically meaningful phenological asynchrony extended over distances of 3.1-4.9. km, well beyond typical gypsy moth dispersal thresholds ({\textless}1. km), meaning that larvae in some parts of the landscape were unable to escape unfavorable phenology by dispersing. Significant spatial heterogeneity in phenological asynchrony clarifies its potential to affect gypsy moth population dynamics and patterns of defoliation disturbance, in contrast with previous field-based research conducted at smaller spatial scales. Our results suggest that delay of leaf-out in this ecosystem due to inadequate winter chilling may disrupt gypsy moth disturbances, as years where host forest phenology is significantly asynchronous over a majority of the landscape become more common. Our modeling approach is relevant and applicable to a wide range of ecological phenomena that require synchrony of phenological interactions across trophic levels. The results inform forest management by illustrating areas in host dominated landscapes that are most susceptible to defoliation in a given year, allowing for improved planning of insect suppression activities. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Orientation of insects to host plants and conspecifics is the result of detection and integration of chemical and physical cues present in the environment. Sensory organs have evolved to be sensitive to important signals, providing neural input for higher order multimodal processing and behavioral output. Here we report experiments to determine decisions made by Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, in response to isolated stimuli and multimodal combinations of signals on a locomotion compensator. Our results show that in complete darkness and in the absence of other stimuli, pheromonal stimulation increases attraction behavior of CPB as measured in oriented displacement and walking speed. However, orientation to the pheromone is abolished when presented with the alternative stimulation of a low intensity yellow light in a dark environment. The ability of the pheromone to stimulate these diurnal beetles in the dark in the absence of other stimuli is an unexpected but interesting observation. The predominance of the phototactic response over that to pheromone when low intensity lights were offered as choices seems to confirm the diurnal nature of the insect. The biological significance of the response to pheromone in the dark is unclear. The phototactic response will play a key role in elucidating multimodal stimulation in the host-finding process of CPB, and perhaps other insects. Such information might be exploited in the design of applications to attract and trap CPB for survey or control purposes and other insect pests using similar orientation mechanisms.},

abstract = {For many leaf-feeding herbivores, synchrony in phenology with their host plant is crucial as development outside a narrow phenological time window has severe fitness consequences. In this review, we link mechanisms, adaptation, and population dynamics within a single conceptual framework, needed for a full understanding of the causes and consequences of this synchrony. The physiological mechanisms underlying herbivore and plant phenology are affected by environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature, although not necessarily in the same way. That these different mechanisms lead to synchrony, even if there is spatial and temporal variation in plant phenology, is a result of the strong natural selection acting on the mechanism underlying herbivore phenology. Synchrony has a major impact on the population densities of leaf-feeding Lepidoptera, and years with a high synchrony may lead to outbreaks. Global climate change leads to a disruption of the synchrony between herbivores and their host plants, which may have major impacts for population viability if natural selection is insufficient to restore synchrony.},

abstract = {Host-specificity determination prior to the introduction of non-native natural enemies is a critical component of the risk assessment for modern classical biocontrol programs. In the present study, we assessed the host specificity of a newly described parasitoid, Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazanac, which is native to Northeast Asia, for classical biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, in North America. Along with foreign exploration for natural enemies of EAB in 2010 and 2012, we surveyed ash (. Fraxinus spp.) wood-boring insects and their parasitoids from artificially stressed Oriental ash (. F. rhynchophylla Hance) trees in natural forest stands in the Primorskiy Kray region of Russia. Once colonies of S. galinae were established in U.S. quarantine, we tested the parasitoid against 15 species or groups of North American wood-boring insects that were selected along a continuum from closely related taxa (e.g., Agrilus spp. in the family Buprestidae in Coleoptera) to distantly related ones in Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. While three of the tested insects, Neoclytus acuminatus Fabricius, Podosesia spp. and Hylesinus fraxini Panzer attack ash as their main host, the rest attack non-ash trees such as birch, maple and oak. Results from our field survey in Russia showed that S. galinae did not attack bark beetles (. Hylesinus spp.) or longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae) that coexisted with EAB on infested ash trees. In quarantine laboratory studies, S. galinae did not attack 14 species or groups of non-target wood-boring insects infesting both ash and/or non-ash trees such as birch, maple or red oak. The only non-target attack was on the goldspotted oak borer (GSOB), Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer, infesting red oak. The rate of parasitism on GSOB was significantly lower than on EAB under laboratory conditions that favored parasitism. These findings indicate that the host specificity of S. galinae is restricted within the host genus (. Agrilus).},

abstract = {Biological invasions by nonnative species are a by-product of economic activities, with the vast majority of nonnative species introduced by trade and transport of products and people. Although most introduced species are relatively innocuous, a few species ultimately cause irreversible economic and ecological impacts, such as the chestnut blight that functionally eradicated the American chestnut across eastern North America. Assessments of the economic costs and losses induced by nonnative forest pests are required for policy development and need to adequately account for all of the economic impacts induced by rare, highly damaging pests. To date, countrywide economic evaluations of forest-invasive species have proceeded by multiplying a unit value (price) by a physical quantity (volume of forest products damaged) to arrive at aggregate estimates of economic impacts. This approach is inadequate for policy development because (1) it ignores the dynamic impacts of biological invasions on the evolution of prices, quantities, and market behavior, and (2) it fails to account for the loss in the economic value of nonmarket ecosystem services, such as landscape aesthetics, outdoor recreation, and the knowledge that healthy forest ecosystems exist. A review of the literature leads one to anticipate that the greatest economic impacts of invasive species in forests are due to the loss of nonmarket values. We proposed that new methods for evaluating aggregate economic damages from forest-invasive species need to be developed that quantify market and nonmarket impacts at microscales that are then extended using spatially explicit models to provide aggregate estimates of impacts. Finally, policies that shift the burden of economic impacts from taxpayers and forest landowners onto parties responsible for introducing or spreading invasives, whether through the imposition of tariffs on products suspected of imposing unacceptable risks on native forest ecosystems or by requiring standards on the processing of trade products before they cross international boundaries, may be most effective at reducing their impacts.},

Many insect herbivores change the quality of their host plants, affecting both inter- and intraspecific interactions.

We conclude that host plant quality affects the fecundity of herbivorous insects at both the individual and the population scale.},

abstract = {In studies of animal colouration it is no longer necessary to rely on subjective assessments of colour and conspicuousness, nor on methods which rely upon human vision. This is important because animals vary greatly in colour vision and colour is context-dependent. New methods make it practical to measure the colour spectrum of pattern elements (patches) of animals and their visual backgrounds for the conditions under which patch spectra reach the conspecific's, predator's or prey's eyes. These methods can be used in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. A patch's colour is dependent not only upon its reflectance spectrum, but also upon the ambient light spectrum, the transmission properties of air or water, and the veiling light sprctrum. These factors change with time of day, weather, season and microhabitat, so colours must be measured under the conditions prevalent when colour patterns are normally used. Methods of measuring, classifying and comparing colours are presented, as well as techniques for assessing the conspicuousness of colour patterns as a whole. Some implications of the effect of environmental light and vision are also discussed.},

The software calculates an ecoclimatic index based on the life cycle requirements of a species and thus represents the probability of a viable population to exist at a certain location. Three different climate warming scenarios were considered: temperature increase of 1.4, 3.6 and 5.8 degrees C. Simulations generated with the current climate conditions corresponded well to the current distributions of the species. The climate warming scenarios shifted the northern boundary of the distribution for both of these species north by c. a. 500-700 km. Also the southern edge of the ranges retracted northwards by 100-900 km. The results of this study are in agreement with the results of empirical studies on other species. Being serious pest species, these species pose a potential threat to silviculture and therefore, have to be considered in the planning of forest management practices.},

abstract = {Positive density-dependent mortality occurred during the early and mid larval stages and was primarily due to Compsilura concinnata, a polyphagous parasitoid. The oviposition rate of Parasetigena silvestris, an oligophagous parasitoid of gypsy moths, was initially inversely density-dependent but became positively density-dependent during the late larval period. Phobocampe disparis showed an inversely density-dependent response, and predation by small mammals on pupae deployed in the litter was lower in plots with higher numbers of pupae. If gypsy moth population densities fluctuate asynchronously on a spatial scale of a few hectares, the density-dependent responses of C. concinnata and P. silvestris could suppress the populations to a point where small mammal predation would be able to prevent population increase. This may explain the apparent stability of gypsy moth populations on a region-wide basis for the many years between outbreaks. -from Authors},

abstract = {This paper describes a radio-tracking study of Osmoderma eremita, a large Scarabaeid beetle, living in hollow trees. The study seems to be the first in which radio telemetry has been used with a flying insect in the field. Some 74 adult beetles were tagged with radio transmitters weighing 0.48-0.52 g and having a nominal battery life of 12-20 days. Transmissions were detected at ranges of up to 330 m, with 50-100 m obtained routinely, Contact was lost with 71{\%} of the females and 20{\%} of the males before the end of the nominal lifetime of the transmitter's battery, probably because the transmitter ceased to function. Radio telemetry proved effective in this study and gave dispersal ranges and rates that were consistent with those from a concurrent mark-recapture study in the same area. However, further development of the technique is desirable. The antennas need to be more flexible and the transmitters smaller and lighter. Nevertheless, even the current form of the technique may be suitable for studying short-range dispersal in other large-bodied flight-capable insects. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang is a gregarious larval endoparasitoid native to China and has been introduced to the United States since 2007 for classical biological control of the invasive emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, an exotic beetle responsible for widespread ash mortality. Between 2007-2010, T. planipennisi adults (3,311-4,597 females and approximately 1,500 males per site) were released into each of six forest sites in three counties (Ingham, Gratiot, and Shiawassee) of southern Michigan. By the fall of 2012, the proportion of sampled trees with one or more broods of T. planipennisi increased to 92 and 83{\%} in the parasitoid-release and control plots, respectively, from 33 and 4{\%} in the first year after parasitoid releases (2009 fall for Ingham county sites and 2010 for other sites). Similarly, the mean number of T. planipennisi broods observed from sampled trees increased from less than one brood per tree in the first year after parasitoid releases to 2.46 (at control plots) to 3.08 (at release plots) broods by the fall of 2012. The rates of emerald ash borer larval parasitism by T. planipennisi also increased from 1.2{\%} in the first year after parasitoid releases to 21.2{\%} in the parasitoid-release plots, and from 0.2 to 12.8{\%} for the control plots by the fall of 2012. These results demonstrate that T. planipennisi is established in southern Michigan and that its populations are increasing and expanding. This suggests that T. planipennisi will likely play a critical role in suppressing emerald ash borer populations in Michigan.},

abstract = {For those who have not recognized the disparate natures of tests of statistical hypotheses and tests of scientific hypotheses, one-tailed statistical tests of null hypotheses such as ∂ ≤ 0 or ∂ ≥ 0 have often seemed a reasonable procedure. We earlier reviewed the many grounds for not regarding them as such. To have at least some power for detection of effects in the unpredicted direction, several authors have independently proposed the use of lopsided (also termed split-tailed, directed or one-and-a-half-tailed) tests, two-tailed tests with $\alpha$ partitionedunequally between the two tails of the test statistic distribution. We review the history ofthese proposals and conclude that lopsided tests are never justified. They are based on thesame misunderstandings that have led to massive misuse of one-tailed tests as well as tomuch needless worry, for more than half a century, over the various so-called ‘multiplicity problems'. We discuss from a neo-Fisherian point of view the undesirable properties of multiple comparison procedures based on either (i) maximum potential set-wise (or familywise) type I error rates (SWERs), or (ii) the increasingly fashionable, maximum potential false discovery rates (FDRs). Neither the classical nor the newer multiple comparison procedures based on fixed maximum potential set-wise error rates are helpful to the cogent analysis and interpretation of scientific data.},

abstract = {Warren root collar weevil, Hylobius warreni Wood, is a native, flightless insect distributed throughout the boreal forest of North America. It is an emerging problem in young plantings of lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta variety latifolia, in western Canada, where larval feeding can kill young trees by girdling the root collar. Susceptible plantings are becoming more abundant following salvage harvesting and replanting activities in the wake of an ongoing epidemic of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins). Previous studies using mark-trap-recapture methods found that movement rates of adult H. warreni were elevated in areas with high numbers of dead trees, consistent with a hypothesis that the insects immigrate from stands with high mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality to young plantings in search of live hosts. Sampling methods were necessarily biased to insects captured in traps; however, potentially missing individuals that had died, left the study area, or simply remained stationary. Here, we used harmonic radar to examine weevil movement in three different habitats: open field, forest edge, and within a forest. We were able to reliably monitor all but two of 36 insects initially released, over 96 h (4 d). Weevils released in the open field had the highest rates of movement, followed by weevils released at the forest edge, then weevils released within the forest. Movement declined with decreasing ambient air temperature. Our results suggest that weevils tend to be relatively stationary in areas of live hosts, and hence may concentrate in a suitable area once such habitat is found.},

abstract = {The recent trend for journals to require open access to primary data included in publications has been embraced by many biologists, but has caused apprehension amongst researchers engaged in long-term ecological and evolutionary studies. A worldwide survey of 73 principal investigators (Pls) with long-term studies revealed positive attitudes towards sharing data with the agreement or involvement of the PI, and 93{\%} of PIs have historically shared data. Only 8{\%} were in favor of uncontrolled, open access to primary data while 63{\%} expressed serious concern. We present here their viewpoint on an issue that can have non-trivial scientific consequences. We discuss potential costs of public data archiving and provide possible solutions to meet the needs of journals and researchers. Public data archiving is the archiving of primary data used in publications so that they can be preserved and made accessible to all online. Public data archiving is increasingly required by journals. However, the costs of public data archiving might be underestimated, in particular with respect to long-term studies. Long-term studies have been responsible for the answers to many important questions in evolution and ecology which could only be answered through following the life-histories of individuals for decades. Several papers have been published in favor of public data archiving, but a more balanced viewpoint is necessary to allow a discussion to emerge on a code of ethics and ways to preserve and protect the data, encourage the initiation and continuation of long-term studies, and meet the requirements of the whole scientific community.},

abstract = {The nature of "climate change" will differ with geographical regions and its final impact on ecosystems vary with the extent of temperature increase, changes in irradiance and levels of UVB, amount and patterns of precipitation and humidity, and alterations in the incidence and nature of abiotic disturbances. Despite many uncertainties, there is consensus in the fact that global warming already has and will have impact on the temporal and spatial dynamics of insect herbivores. Ectothermic organisms are affected by the changes in environmental conditions directly in dispersal, reproduction, development and mortality, and indirectly through altered plant nutritional quality, resistance and via community interactions. Ambiguous consequences are to be expected depending on the individual host plant and herbivore species, probably involving altered incidence and intensity of pest outbreaks and changes in distributional ranges. Regions that represent northern or upper limits of occurrence, such as the Alps or the boreal zone, are likely to be affected most by an increase in stability and population density of certain pest species, such as defoliating insects or bark beetles. At the same time, temperature increase and drought will render areas of distribution in southern and continental parts of Europe less suitable for heat susceptible species, which will probably not only result in northwards shifts, but range contractions. The review is based on chapters of the "Study on impacts of climate change on European forests and options for adaptation" led by the European Forest Institute (Efi) and on results of the EU project "PROMOTH - Global change and pine processionary moth: a new challenge for integrated pest management". Thaumetopoea pityocampa serves as illustrative example for insect herbivores whose latitudinal and altitudinal distribution is mainly controlled by temperature and already modified by global warming. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Agrilus planipennis, the emerald ash borer (EAB), is an invasive forest pest causing significant economic and ecological impacts. EAB is attacked by some native natural enemies, the most significant being woodpeckers, which can remove between 30 and 95{\%} of the EAB larvae in a tree. However, despite high woodpecker predation rates, EAB populations continue to grow. Management of EAB focuses on classical biological control, with the introduction of four parasitic wasps from Asia. Because both woodpeckers and larval parasitoids attack mature EAB larvae, their impacts overlap and potentially interact. This study examines the relationship between native woodpecker predation and parasitism by the introduced parasitoids S. agrili and T. planipennisi. We established a cohort of parasitized larvae on select ash trees and then used screening to exclude woodpeckers from some sections of the tree. We show that while woodpeckers had no effect on observed parasitism rates of individual trees, the presence of parasitized larvae changed woodpecker foraging behavior and resulted in significantly lower overall foraging by woodpeckers. We hypothesize these changes are due to these larval parasitoids being a lower quality food reward. Parasitism of EAB larvae could contribute to a decrease in patch quality for woodpeckers such that they would quit foraging sooner than expected if it were a high-quality, un-parasitized patch. This study fills a gap in our understanding of the complex relationship between woodpecker mortality and parasitism mortality of EAB and our results demonstrate that this relationship may have broad implications for the EAB biological control program.},

abstract = {We assessed the relative influence of total phosphorus and piscivore biomass on the abundance of benthivores, soft-rayed planktivores, spiny-rayed planktivores, zooplankton and phytoplankton in 69 shallow lakes in the prairie and parkland areas of Minnesota, USA. Piscivore biomass was the best predictor for three of these response variables, exhibiting a negative relationship with soft-rayed planktivores, a positive relationship with benthivores, and a weaker positive relationship with large-bodied cladocerans. Total phosphorus and piscivores comprised the best model for predicting spiny-rayed planktivores, while neither variable showed any strong relationship to small-bodied cladocerans. Total phosphorus was positively related to phytoplankton abundance, and was the best predictor among all candidate models. Moreover, contrary to predictions of trophic cascade theory, the relationship between chlorophyll a and total phosphorus did not differ between lakes with and without piscivores. Our results indicated top-down influences of piscivores extended through parts of two trophic levels, but failed to influence zooplankton – phytoplankton interactions, leaving phytoplankton abundance constrained largely by total phosphorus. Lack of a relationship between piscivores and phytoplankton was likely due to high densities of larval planktivores less susceptible to piscivory, as well as positive influences of spiny-rayed planktivores and benthivores on algal abundance. These results support the idea that top–down influences of piscivores on phytoplankton abundance may be reduced in more diverse fish communities where some prey species are less susceptible to piscivory.},

abstract = {The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae is a native species currently experiencing large-scale outbreaks in western North American pine forests. We sought to describe the pattern of genetic variation across the range of this species, to determine whether there were detectable genetic differences between D. ponderosae occupying different host trees in common localities, and to determine whether there was molecular evidence for a past demographic expansion. Using a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and mitochondrial sequencing analyses, we found evidence of genetic structuring among populations that followed a broad isolation-by-distance pattern. Our results suggest that the geographical pattern of gene flow follows the core distribution of the principal D. ponderosae host species, around rather than across the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts. Patterns of haplotype diversity and divergence were consistent with a range-wide population expansion. This signal was particularly pronounced in the northern part of the species' range, where outbreak activity is currently increasing. Using AFLP markers, we were unable to detect significant differences among groups of insects sampled from different host trees in common locations. Incidentally, we found that a large proportion of the polymorphic AFLP markers were gender-specific, occurring only in males. While we did not include these markers in our analyses, this finding warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, EAB) is an invasive forest pest and the target of an extensive biological control program designed to mitigate EAB-caused ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality. Since 2007, hymenopteran parasitoids of EAB from northeastern Asia have been released as biological control agents in North America, including Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an egg parasitoid; Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a larval endoparasitoid; and Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval ectoparasitoid. Following parasitoid releases in new locations, methods currently used to document presence and establishment and to monitor dispersal of parasitoids in the field were simultaneously evaluated, including destructive sampling of entire trees and deployment of egg sentinel logs (ESLs), egg sentinel cups (ESCs), larval sentinel logs (LSLs), and yellow pan traps (YPTs). All three parasitoids were recovered using YPTs and destructive sampling of trees. Spathius agrili was the only species to be recovered using LSLs, however, results indicate YPTs were as effective as LSLs. YPTs were also as effective as destructive sampling of entire trees for O. agrili and S. agrili detection. YPT trap catches were significantly associated with egg parasitism on sampled trees by O. agrili, but not for larval parasitoids. Additional research indicated YPTs are effective in recovering O. agrili and T. planipennisi at distances as great as 20 m from release points. It is therefore recommended that YPTs be used as the preferred method for parasitoid recovery as the other methods are much more labor intensive and prone to difficulties.},

abstract = {Biological invasions resulting from international trade can cause major environmental and economic impacts. Propagule pressure is perhaps the most important factor influencing establishment, although actual arrival rates of species are rarely recorded. Furthermore, the pool of potential invaders includes many species that vary in their arrival rate and establishment potential. Therefore, we stress that it is essential to consider the size and composition of species pools arriving from source regions when estimating probabilities of establishment and effects of pathway infestation rates. To address this, we developed a novel framework and modeling approach to enable prediction of future establishments in relation to changes in arrival rate across entire species pools. We utilized 13 828 border interception records from the United States and New Zealand for 444 true bark beetle (Scolytinae) and longhorned beetle (Cerambycidae) species detected between 1949 and 2008 as proxies for arrival rates to model the relationship between arrival and establishment rates. Nonlinearity in this relationship implies that measures intended to reduce the unintended transport of potential invaders (such as phytosanitary treatments) must be highly effective in order to substantially reduce the rate of future invasions, particularly if trade volumes continue to increase. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Hylobius warreni Wood, also known as the Warren root collar weevil, is a flightless insect that feeds on conifers throughout the boreal forests of Canada. Mature trees typically can withstand feeding, but larval feeding around the root collar may cause mortality to young trees. Recently, a large outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) has killed a high proportion of mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas variety latifolia) across British Columbia, Canada. This raises concerns that adult weevils may migrate from mature forests with reduced host pools into adjacent young forests that had been salvaged and replanted. To study movement of these walking weevils in different habitat types, we constructed three research plots consisting of various combinations of live-, dead-, and mixed (i.e., live and dead)-tree habitats. We observed dispersal patterns of individually labeled insects using a novel insect trap attached to the base of trees. Approximately 35{\%} of insects were recaptured over 1 mo. Weevils were least likely to be recaptured proximate to the release location when released in a habitat with dead trees. Movement rates therein were almost double the rates of insects moving through live- or mixed-tree habitats. Our findings support the hypothesis that H. warreni may disperse out of habitats with dead trees into areas with higher proportions of green trees. Our findings are discussed in the context of habitat discrimination and potential increases in herbivory by H. warreni in western Canada given salvage harvesting activities after outbreaks of mountain pine beetle.},

The tag consists of a wire antenna attached$\backslash$nto a Schottky diode, which uses the original radar signal as$\backslash$nan energy source, re-emitting a harmonic of the transmitted wavelength.$\backslash$nTwo forms of harmonic radar use this basic technology to$\backslash$nstudy insect movement. The more sophisticated form consists of a$\backslash$nground-based scanning radar station that tracks the movement of a$\backslash$ntagged insect on a circular radar display. A simpler, “off-the-shelf”$\backslash$nform of harmonic radar is a commercially available, light-weight,$\backslash$nhandheld transmitter/receiver from RECCO Rescue Systems. We$\backslash$nbriefly review both of these forms and describe our experience$\backslash$nmonitoring the movement of carabid beetles in agricultural habitats$\backslash$nwith the handheld transmitter/receiver. We identified a commercial$\backslash$nsource of diodes compatible with the RECCO transmitter/receiver$\backslash$nand tested several diode and wire combinations. We found that a tag$\backslash$nbuilt with a diode attached to a single section of 8-cm wire (monopole)$\backslash$nwas more appropriate for marking carabids. Tags built from$\backslash$nflexible Teflon-coated wires were an improvement on tags built with$\backslash$nstiff, aluminum wire, but beetle movement was still hindered. In corn$\backslash$nand soybean fields, large carabids (Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir and$\backslash$nHarpalus pennsylvanicus, (DeG.) Coleoptera: Carabidae) could be$\backslash$nrecaptured even when they burrowed out of sight 3 to 9 cm below$\backslash$nthe soil surface. We discuss the trade-offs between tag detection and$\backslash$ndurability that occur when designing a tag for a given organism.$\backslash$nAlthough the technique shows promise, producing a tag that does$\backslash$nnot hinder movement of the target insect in the field will require$\backslash$nfurther development.},

Response properties and spectral sensitivities of a functional class of medulla neurons that received dominant input from a single stemma in the swallowtail butterfly larva were examined with regard to neutral and chromatic backgrounds. 2. Eight types of neurons were dominated by a dichromatic stemma with blue and green receptors. Six showed specific color-opponent responses mediated by two receptors on different backgrounds; one showed strong color opponency because of fairly balanced antagonistic input on the neutral (dark and white) background; the other five usually had weak or concealed color opponency on a neutral background but became strongly color opponent when appropriate chromatic illumination was present on the background. The most complex neuron gave excitatory responses on a dark background, inhibitory responses on a white background, and color-opponent responses on a chromatic (yellow) background. 3. The remaining two types of neurons dominated by the dichromatic stemma showed non-color-opponent and broad action spectra ascribable to a synergistic effect of the two classes of photoreceptors. 4. All eight types of neurons dominated by a trichromatic stemma (with UV, blue, and green receptors) were color opponent. Five showed strong color-opponent responses with the mediation of the three classes of receptors or only two (UV and green) on a neutral background. The others revealed distinct color opponency in the presence of UV or green illumination on the background. 5. The larval medulla neurons described may form parallel, elementary color-coded channels in the medulla neuropile to combine the outputs of the different color receptors in a single visual unit (stemma) into specific color-opponent signals. They probably correspond to columnar relay neurons in the medulla of the adult insects with a compound eye.},

Contrary to our null expectations, the proportionate numbers of pupae compared with larvae on the various host species were not equal. Hosts more preferred by larvae were less preferred by pupae, and vice versa . For example, pupae were disproportionately abundant on host species like Acer pensylvanicum L., Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch, and Juglans cinerea L. which are not generally favored larval hosts. Conversely, favored larval hosts like Quercus rubra L. and Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch carried lower numbers of pupae than expected from the numbers of larvae feeding on them. Such differential utilization of host trees by larvae versus pupae, which can arise either from host-dependent differences in larval mortality or from late instar migration between hosts, may contribute to maintaining the broad polyphagy of gypsy moth larvae.},

abstract = {Searching behavior is an active movement by which insects seek resources. It is an important kind of behavior because insects thereby acquire food, mates, oviposition and nesting sites, and refugia. Since these resources are absolutely essential for the growth, development, and maintenance of the individual, and for ensuring the success of future generations, efficient searching mechanisms and accurate assessment mechanisms are crucial for an individual's chances of survival and reproduction. Searching behavior incurs costs in addition to the energy uscd for locomotion. These costs include the risks of predation while engaged in searching, and the time taken away from other activities such as holding territory or protecting nests. Natural selection, presumed to be the driving force for morphological and physiological adaptations, would also be expected to favor searching mechanisms that maximize the difference between searching costs and benefits and that reduce various types of risks incurred while searching. Searching behavior represents the confluence of three kinds of factors: (i) the biological characteristics and abilities of an insect, including locomotory patterns and perception of sensory information, (ii) external environmental factors determining the resources available and the risks inherent in their quest; and (iii) internal factors, such as deprivation or sexual receptivity, determining what an individual needs at a particular time.},

It has spread to over 860,000 km 2 in North America, but this still only represents 1/4 of its susceptible host range in the United States. To delay defoliation in the remaining susceptible host range, the government maintains a barrier zone and a quarantine, reflecting a presumption that anthropogenic factors are important in the spread of gypsy moth. We develop a model framework that relates these factors along with biophysical characteristics to a county's susceptibility to gypsy moth invasion. We then compile a dataset for counties within 200 km of the infested area and use trap catch data from 1999 to 2007 to estimate the probability of gypsy moth presence. As expected, gypsy moth is more likely to be found close to the population front and to traps that recorded moths in the previous year. However, when controlling for these factors, our most robust finding is that the use of wood for home heating and energy is consistently positively correlated with the presence of gypsy moth. In contrast, the movement of wood products by industry, which is actively regulated by state and federal governments, is rarely correlated with the presence of gypsy moth. This is consistent with effective regulation of the movement of goods by industry, but not by the public. Our findings provide empirical support for the importance and challenge of firewood as a vector for non-native forest insects. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Furthermore, there were consistently more larvae under burlap bands on trees that were continuously banded than there were on trees from which bands were temporarily removed. Several hypotheses were proposed to explain this result. The hypothesis that deposition of silk trails leads other larvae to the bands was ruled out as an explanation of this result because the experimental removal of silk trails did not significantly affect the number of larvae under bands. Accumulation of moribund larvae under the bands was also ruled out as an explanation because at endemic density levels, very few larvae remained under burlap bands at night; those that did remain were almost entirely in the process of molting. The higher number of larvae found under bands on continuously banded trees was attributed to an accumulation of larvae from surrounding trees that were not banded. This accumulation resulted from a decreased rate of off-tree movement caused by the presence of burlap bands.},

abstract = {Climate change is likely to induce range divergence of invasive herbivore insects and native host trees given their different response rates to temperature increase. In this study we used the invasion of emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), which is host-specific to ash (Fraxinus spp.), to demonstrate the significant implications of this climate change induced insect-host divergence formanagement of invasive species. The least constrained climatic limits of EAB were derived from its native range in East Asia, then projected to North America under the current and future climate conditions, and finally compared with the assumedly static ash distribution. Results suggest that the divergence between the invasion range of EAB and the distribution of ash in North America is likely to enlarge as climate change proceeds. In this case, many original ash stands could remain intact in the southern range, possibly forming refugia of the host species. The realization of this prediction, however, requires that the spread of EAB be reduced by continuedmanagement effort to allow climate change to take effect in time.Our study highlights the important role climate change has in the course of biological invasion and herbivore- host dynamics, which provides key information for continental scale pest risk prediction and strategic planning. 1},

As it continues to spread, it could functionally extirpate ash with devastating economic and ecological impacts. Little was known about EAB when it was first discovered in North America in 2002, but substantial advances in understanding of EAB biology, ecology, and management have occurred since. Ash species indigenous to China are generally resistant to EAB and may eventually provide resistance genes for introgression into North American species. EAB is characterized by stratified dispersal resulting from natural and human-assisted spread, and substantial effort has been devoted to the development of survey methods. Early eradication efforts were abandoned largely because of the difficulty of detecting and delineating infestations.

However, in the past few decades ecol- ogists have become increasingly interested in the use of Bayesian methods of data analysis. In this article I provide guidance to ecologists who would like to decide whether Bayesian methods can be used to improve their conclusions and predictions. I begin by providing a concise summary of Bayesian methods of analysis, including a comparison of differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference when using hierarchical models. Next I pro- vide a list of problems where Bayesian methods of analysis may arguably be preferred over frequentist methods. These problems are usually encountered in analyses based on hierarchical models of data. I describe the essentials required for applying modern methods of Bayesian com- putation, and I use real-world examples to illustrate these methods. I conclude by summarizing what I perceive to be the main strengths and weaknesses of using Bayesian methods to solve ecological inference problems.},

abstract = {The role of olfaction and vision in the close-ranging flying and walking orientation of male gypsy moths , Lymantria dispar (L.), to females was studied in the forest and in the laboratory. In the forest, feral males found an isolated pheromone source as readily as one supplemented with female visual cues; dead, acetonerinsed females deployed without pheromone received virtually no visitations. In flight tunnel choice experiments using cylinders as surrogate trees and pheromone in different spatial configurations, visual attributes of the female did not influence either the males' choice of landing site or the efficiency with which they located the female. Rather, the presence of pheromone on the cylinder was necessary to elicit orientation as well as landing and walking on the cylinder. When a female visual model was placed in various positions around a pheromone source, walking males oriented primarily to the chemical stimulus. There were, however, indications that males would alter their walking paths in response to female visual cues over short distances ( .},

Fundamental ecological research is both intrinsically interesting and provides the basic knowledge required to answer applied questions of importance to the management of the natural world. The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n2. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n3. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n4. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n5.

Specimens depleted of antifreeze proteins, however, froze by inoculation following supercooling to temperatures at about 9-10??C below mean haemolymph melting points. In R. inquisitor, the capacity to inhibit inoculative freezing provided by antifreeze proteins was much smaller. The thermal hysteresis activity ranged from 2.6 to 6.2??C in individuals maintained in continuous darkness and between 1.8-5.8??C among specimens treated in continuous light. Wet-surface cerambycid beetles froze following supercooling to temperatures at 1.3 and 2.7??C below mean hysteresis-freezing points.

abstract = {The free-flight behaviour of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), the sweet potato whitefly, was investigated in a vertical flight chamber. A mercury-vapour lamp presented from above induced a phototactic flight response. Although flight propensity was comparable from 06.00 to 19.00 hours, flight duration was maximum between 06.00 and 10.00 hours. Males flew longer than females and their mean flight duration remained constant throughout the day. Females flew longer from 06.00 to 13.00 hours than from 13.00 to 19.00 hours. Both sexes were capable of sustaining flight for more than 2 h, although less than 5{\%} of those tested did so. Flight activity also was influenced by age and by host quality. The propensity to take off, proportion exhibiting phototactic orientation and flight duration varied with the age of the whitefly. Host quality influenced the timing of flight behaviour. Whiteflies reared on senescing plants exhibited greater take-off rates and initiated longer phototactic flights up to 4 days following adult eclosion when compared to individuals reared on vegetative plants. Thereafter, individuals reared on vegetative plants exhibited greater response levels. Whiteflies reared on vegetative plants weighed more and survived longer than did individuals reared on senescing plants. Whiteflies that responded to the overhead light initially exhibited a strong photokinetic and phototactic response. Over the course of the flight, these re- sponses declined and flight instability increased, as indicated by an overall decrease in the mean rate of climb, accompanied by an increase in the variability of this parameter and an increase in horizontal displacement.

abstract = {The introduction of high-quality, useable generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) software in the mid-2000s changed the conversation regarding the analysis of non-normal data from designed experiments. For well over half a century, the reigning paradigm called for using analysis of variance (ANOVA), either assuming approximate normality of the original data or applying a variance-stabilizing transformation. The appearance of GLMMs creates a dilemma. The ANOVA-based analyses and GLMM-based analyses often yield mutually contradictory results. What results should a researcher report, and how should the choice be justified? If GLMM-based analysis is preferred—and there is increasing evidence that this is the case—approaches to data analysis ingrained while learning ANOVA must be unlearned and relearned. The basic issues associated with the analysis of non-normal data are reviewed here, the thought processes required for GLMMs and how they differ from traditional ANOVA are introduced, and three examples are presented, giving an overview of GLMM-based analysis. The three examples include discussions of what is known to date about the relative merits of GLMM- and ANOVA-based analysis of non-normal data.},

abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Levy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Levy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to, sustain Levy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Levy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Levy walks. This model shows that Levy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the. ability of performing Levy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.},

abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into ‘those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it'. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an ‘all- statement', referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept ‘pseudoreplication' amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that adults of flightless long-winged (macropterous) and short-winged (brachypterous) morphs of Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) (Heteroptera) differ in their walking path characteristics and dispersal ability. Descriptive variables such as the distance moved, mean velocity, time in observation zone, turn angle, angular velocity, meander and sinuosity were computed from walking track data obtained with the use of the computerized system EthoVision. The macropterous bugs differed from the brachypterous ones by higher mean and angular velocity and distance moved, by shorter time spent in the observation zone, and by lower turn angle, meander and sinuosity parameters. The analysis of locomotory tracks revealed that the walking path of macropters is less tortuous than that of brachypters. Estimation of mean spatial displacement distance attained by two wing morphs indicate higher dispersal activity of macropters, and an important role of the macropterous morph in the dispersal strategy of this bug and spreading of the macropterous genotype into new areas. The results obtained are in accordance with our hypothesis that flightless macropters of P. apterus maintain higher dispersal ability than brachypters despite the evolutionary loss of flight capability.},

abstract = {Emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is an invasive pest of serious concern in North America. To complement ongoing biological control efforts, Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazenac (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a recently-described specialist parasitoid of emerald ash borer larvae, is being released for the first time in the United States. To better understand its reproductive and developmental biology, and to improve outcomes of mass-rearing, we investigated the effects of constant ambient temperature (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C) on immature development time, sex ratio, pre-oviposition period, fecundity and survivorship. Results show that between 20 and 30 °C immature development time was inversely associated with temperature, with adults emerging ≈38, 32, and 25 d after oviposition at 20, 25, and 30 °C, respectively. At 15 °C larvae developed to 5th instars and spun cocoons before development was arrested, while at 35 °C parasitoid eggs desiccated and did not hatch. Sex ratio of adult progeny that were exposed to different temperatures, from eggs, was not affected. When newly (≤24 h-old) emerged female parasitoids were provided larval hosts throughout their lifetimes, adults parasitized at all temperatures except 35 °C, although parasitism rate was highest (35{\%}), as was lifetime fecundity (43 progeny/female), when females lived at 25 °C. Survivorship was inversely associated with temperature, with ovipositing females living for {\textgreater}60 d when maintained at 15 °C, and females held at 35 °C living for {\textless}10 d. Life table analyses showed S. galinae had the highest net reproductive rate (R0 = 27.8) and intrinsic rate of increase (rm = 0.29) when female parasitoids were maintained at 25 °C for their lifetimes, suggesting this is the optimal temperature to rear S. galinae.},

abstract = {SummaryWe investigated individual foraging components of the western harvester ant,Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, in the native seed background of a shrub-steppe environment. Our study identified factors affecting foraging movements and seed selection by individual ants. Some assumptions and predictions of central-place foraging theory and a correlated random walk were evaluated for individual foragers. Results showed that ant size was only weakly correlated with the seed sizes harvested; seed size was a more important constraint than a predictor of seed selection. Individual ants spent more time in localized search behavior than traveling between search areas and nests.P. occidentalis foragers encountered seeds randomly with respect to time, and handled a mean of 1.7 seeds/trip. A correlation of increased search effort with greater travel distances was consistent with central-place foraging theory but, contrary to it, search and travel effort were not associated with energetic reward.Individual ants exhibited fidelity in both search site and native seed species. Spatial analyses of foraging movements showed a highly oriented travel path while running, and an area-restricted path while searching. Searching ants moved in a manner consistent with a correlated random walk. The deterministic component of patch fidelity and the stochastic component of search may override energetic foraging decisions in individualP. occidentalis ants.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of date of hatch, maternal population quality, larval density, air temperature, and host foliage on the dispersal of neonate gypsy maths, Lymantria dispar (L.), under field conditions. Larval dispersal significantly increased with date by nearly fourfold, but neither maternal population quality nor crowding had a significant effect on dispersal activity. Neither variation in air temperature or length of egg chill were related to the increase in dispersal with date; this trend was best explained by the combined effects of foliar changes during leaf expansion and declines in host quality because of induced plant defenses. Our results indicate that environmental factors in the current generation, such as leaf expansion after budburst, have a much larger influence than maternal population quality on the dispersal of neonate gypsy moths under natural conditions.},

abstract = {1. Many species of forest Lepidoptera have cyclic population dynamics. Although there are numerous potential causes, including interactions with predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and food-plant quality, strongly density-dependent interactions are often difficult to demonstrate. Both autocorrelation analysis and attractor-reconstruction methods have recently been applied to a number of species' time series. Results suggest that complex dynamics, i.e. cycles or deterministic chaos, may be more prevalent than once thought, and that higher-dimensioned models are necessary. 2. We develop a two- dimensional difference equation model that relates the average quality of individuals to patterns of abundance. The delayed density dependence is caused by transmission of quality through generations via maternal effects. We show that the maternal effect model can produce patterns of population fluctuations similar to those displayed by one class of host-parasitoid models. 3. We review empirical evidence for maternal and quality effects in dynamics of forest Lepidoptera. We fit the maternal effect and delayed logistic models to six species of forest moths for which delayed density dependence and maternal or quality effects have been found. The maternal effect model was a good predictor of the period of the oscillations for the species that we examined. We discuss why models of this type give better fits to moth cycles than do first order models with added delays.},

abstract = {Arthropods, as poikilotherms, adapt to cold environments in a variety of ways that include extension of locomotory activity to low temperatures, enhancement of metabolic rate and maintenance of a positive energy balance whenever possible. The ecological implications for many such animals are extension of the life cycle and a requirement for an individual to overwinter several times. Prolonged sub-zero temperatures increase the risk of tissue freezing, and two main strategies have been evolved, first avoidance of freezing by supercooling, and secondly, tolerance of extracellular ice. In the first strategy, freezing is invariably lethal and extensive supercooling (to -30 {\textless}latex{\textgreater}{\$}{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}{\textless}/latex{\textgreater}C and below) occurs through elimination or masking of potential ice nucleators in the body and accumulation of cryoprotective substances such as polyhydric alcohols and sugars. Such species are termed freezing intolerant. The second strategy, freezing tolerance, is uncommon in arthropods and other invertebrates, and usually occurs in a single life stage of a species. Freezing of liquid in the extracellular compartment is promoted by proteinaceous ice nucleators. Freezing is therefore protective, and the lethal temperature is well below the supercooling point in freezing tolerant individuals, whereas in most freezing intolerant species it is close to or at the supercooling point. Proteins also act as antifreezes in insects of both strategies, producing a thermal hysteresis by lowering the freezing point of haemolymph in a non-colligative fashion while not affecting the melting point temperature. Recent studies and developments in arthropod cold tolerance are discussed against this background, and a broader approach than hitherto is advocated, which integrates ecological information with physiological data.},

This model is a first order correlated random walk model in which the following two biological constraints are integrated into the Brownian motion model: bilateral symmetry and the cephalocaudal polarization that leads to a tendency to go forward. The main properties of the model were studied by numerical simulations using a pseudo-random generator. It was found that the spatial pattern of search paths could be quantified by a single numerical index of sinuosity. Some advice on the concrete use of this model is given. Correlated random walk diffusion was studied in relation to the sinuosity by analysing the probabilistic distribution of the bee-line distance between the first and last points of a path. Some theoretical applications of this model are developed. ?? 1988 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Prior studies led to the premise that gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), populations tend to increase numerically from innocuous levels in environments where abundant, sheltered resting and pupation locations reduce the probability that the growing insects will be eaten by vertebrates. Although such locations may be found anywhere within the environment, and may either occur naturally or be introduced by man, they are usually above the forest floor, close to or part of a suitable host tree, and dark, dry, and rough. Test results described herein both supported this premise and led to the conclusion that environmental conditions that tend to produce or represent abundant sheltered locations for this pest also tend to produce or represent potential outbreak foci. Such environmental conditions include dry, rocky ridges, excessively drained sands, remnant “wolf-trees”, and ice storms. Other environmental conditions that may contribute to the release of gypsy moth populations from innocuous levels include changes in habitat or food sources of predators, tree age, nutrient and moisture deficiencies, air pollution, land abuse, and climate. Qualitative differences between individual insects may also contribute to population release from innocuous levels.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L., Lymantriinae) is a major pest of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) forests in Europe, but how its infections scale with foliage physiological characteristics, in particular with photosynthesis rates and emissions of volatile organic compounds has not been studied. Differently from the majority of insect herbivores, large larvae of L. dispar rapidly consume leaf area, and can also bite through tough tissues, including secondary and primary leaf veins. Given the rapid and devastating feeding responses, we hypothesized that infection of Q. robur leaves by L. dispar leads to disproportionate scaling of leaf photosynthesis and constitutive isoprene emissions with damaged leaf area, and to less prominent enhancements of induced volatile release. Leaves with 0{\%} (control) to 50{\%} of leaf area removed by larvae were studied. Across this range of infection severity, all physiological characteristics were quantitatively correlated with the degree of damage, but all these traits changed disproportionately with the degree of damage. The net assimilation rate was reduced by almost 10-fold and constitutive isoprene emissions by more than 7-fold, whereas the emissions of green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, methyl salicylate and the homoterpene (3E)-4,8-dimethy-1,3,7-nonatriene scaled negatively and almost linearly with net assimilation rate through damage treatments. This study demonstrates that feeding by large insect herbivores disproportionately alters photosynthetic rate and constitutive isoprene emissions. Furthermore, the leaves have a surprisingly large capacity for enhancement of induced emissions even when foliage photosynthetic function is severely impaired.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

Population-wide management of EAB is focused on biological control through the introduction of four parasitic wasps, including the recently approved larval parasitoid Spathius galinae. This species was approved for release in the north-central and northeastern US in 2015 and its long ovipositor (4–5.3 mm) is expected to allow it to reach EAB larvae in larger ash trees with thicker bark, than the only other successfully established larval parasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi. Using experimentally infested logs of varying diameters in the laboratory, we measured the effect of bark thickness on oviposition of S. galinae to understand its potential value for controlling EAB in trees of differing diameter and bark thickness. Parasitism by S. galinae was highest when bark was thin ({\textless}4 mm) and dropped significantly as valley bark thickness increased beyond 6.5 mm. We also found that EAB larval feeding on inner bark, reduced the bark thickness directly over the larval galleries by 0.4 mm on average. Our results suggest that S. galinae will be able to reach EAB larvae in {\textgreater}95{\%} of all ash in the northeastern United States. S. galinae will likely play a vital role in providing additional control and in supporting ash regeneration in aftermath areas of EAB invasions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we briefly review the ability of insects and mites to survive exposures to low temperatures and discuss its characteristics. The potential implications and uses for post-harvest pest control are also addressed as a paradigm of possible expansion in pest management. Exposure to low temperatures is the crucial factor for the induction of cold hardiness. Also, the contribution of the Super Cooling Point (SCP) is discussed. Moreover, insects and mites vary remarkably in their susceptibility to low temperatures, as some show a more ???stable??? cold tolerance while others are more opportunistic. There are certain cases where low temperatures can be utilized in the control of stored product and quarantine insects and mites. In the literature, there are numerous published studies that illustrate this use, on the basis of non-chemical based pest management. These studies are reviewed in the present paper, illustrating the potential use of low temperatures for pest control, in an IPM-based strategy, with particular emphasis at the post-harvest stages of agricultural commodities, where abiotic conditions are often more easily controlled.},

abstract = {In temperate regions, few insects are able to avoid exposure to low environmental temperatures during the winter. Notable exceptions include the monarch butterfly, which mav, migu rate more than 1000-milest o warmer climates, and the honeybee, which maintains constant hive temperatures near 35" C by behavioral and physiological activities of the colony (Heinrich 198 1, Southwick and Heldmaier 1987). Other species avoid low-temperature extremes by vertical migration into the soil or the selection of protected hibernacula. However, for the many insects unable to avoid exposure to low temperatures, the capacity to cold-harden is required for overwintering survival. Although many overwintering insects seek protected overwintering sites in leaf litter or beneath the bark of trees, the most cold-tolerant species are those that overwinter in exposed sites, such as the Arctic caterpillar (Gynaephora), which overwinters on rocky surfaces, or fly larvae in plant galls that extend above the snowline, thus exposing their inhabitants to the extremes of fluctuation in ambient temperatures (Ring and Tesar 1981).},

abstract = {Female gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L., from 46 geographic strains were evaluated for flight capability and related traits. Males from 31 of the same strains were evaluated for genetic diversity using two polymorphic cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial DNA restriction sites, the nuclear FS1 marker, and four microsatellite loci. Females capable of strong directed flight were found in strains that originated from Asia, Siberia, and the northeastern parts of Europe, but flight capability was not fixed in most strains. No flight-capable females were found in strains from the United States or southern and western Europe. Wing size and musculature were shown to correlate with flight capability and potentially could be used in predicting female flight capability. The mtDNA haplotypes broadly separated the gypsy moth strains into three groups: North American, European/Siberian, and Asian. Specific microsatellite or FS1 alleles were only fixed in a few strains, and there was a gradual increase in the frequency of alleles dominant in Asia at both the nuclear and microsatellite loci moving geographically from west to east. When all the genetic marker information was used, 94{\%} of the individuals were accurately assigned to their broad geographic group of origin (North American, European, Siberian, and Asian), but female flight capability could not be predicted accurately. This suggests that gene flow or barriers to it are important in determining the current distribution of flight-capable females and shows the need for added markers when trying to predict female flight capability in introduced populations, especially when a European origin is suspected.},

The data comprise field mark-recapture studies in relatively homogeneous habitats. For eight of the species, the cumulative frequency distributions of dispersal distances are consistent with a model of movement by passive diffusion. The observed departures from passive diffusion indicate the directions in which we need to modify our mathematical descriptions of movement if we are to develop realistic models of population dynamics and dispersal. The analyses also synthesize in a standard way the relative dispersal rates of several ecologically similar species. The variation both within and between species in diffusion coefficients is striking-certainly sufficient to generate significant consequences for population dynamics and interactions.},

abstract = {Field boundaries play an important role as refuges, food sources and corridors for invertebrates and vertebrates, and increasing farmland fragmentation impacts on these functions. However, hedgerows and other structures can also impede dispersal by flying insects. The current work uses the pollen of Phacelia tanacetifolia in hover fly guts as a marker to assess hover fly movement in farm landscapes. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Phacelia pollen was found in the guts of Ephisyrphus balteatus and Metasyrphus corollae (United Kingdom) and Melanostoma fasciatum (New Zealand) at distances up to 200 m from the source, when there were no barriers between the flowers and the traps used to catch the flies. The rate of decline over distance in the proportion of flies containing pollen was similar for the two countries. The extent to which four replicated field boundary types impeded hover fly movement was tested using post-and-wire fences, lines of poplars (Populus spp.) with gaps, dense poplars and controls (no potential barriers). Phacelia was planted on one side of each boundary, and along the centre of the control plots. The relative presence of the pollen in flies on both sides of the barriers showed that both types of poplar boundary restricted the movement of the flies, but the fence had no effect. In a separate experiment, gravid females of M. fasciatum were captured at a greater height on a shade-cloth fence than were non-gravid females and males. The implications of this work include the functioning and persistence of metapopulations and the influence of field boundaries on population recovery of beneficial invertebrates following pesticide-induced mortality. If field boundaries contribute to a temporal asynchrony between pest and natural enemy populations, this needs to be considered along with the well-established roles of boundaries as refugia for, and sources of, beneficial arthropods.},

abstract = {Understanding interspecific competition among insect parasitoids is important in designing classical biological control programs that involve multiple species introductions. Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazenac, a new idiobiont ectoparasitoid from the Russian Far East, currently is being considered for introduction to the United States for biological control of the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, whereas Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang, a koinobiont endoparasitoid native to China, is another natural enemy that already has been introduced in the same program. In a laboratory study, we examined the potential interactions between these two parasitoids when they compete for the same emerald ash borer host larvae. In multiple-choice assays where healthy emerald ash borer larvae were presented along with emerald ash borer larvae previously parasitized by T. planipennisi at different times, S. galinae attacked host larvae already parasitized by T. planipennisi for up to 4 d, but not 8 d. However, parasitism rates were significantly lower in previously parasitized hosts as compared with healthy host larvae. In no-choice tests where S. galinae females were presented either with healthy emerald ash borer larvae or emerald ash borer larvae parasitized by T. planipennisi at several earlier time points, S. galinae again parasitized significantly more healthy host larvae than T. planipennisi-parasitized larvae. These results suggest that the ectoparasitoid S. galinae can discriminate between healthy host larvae and T. planipennisi-parasitized larvae, and competitive interactions between the two parasitoids are likely to be minimal if coreleased by the emerald ash borer biological control program. {\textcopyright} 2012 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract = {Oak species are the favored host of gypsy moth populations in the north-eastern United States, although the herbivore expands its host range dramatically during an outbreak. Pitch pine, a secondary host because of its unacceptability for early devel-opment, was found to be frequently used for oviposition in oak-pitch pine forests with non-outbreak populations. This observation led to the study of ecological and behavioral factors that can contribute to the use of a secondary host under low-density conditions by an irruptive herbivore species. A series of manipulative field and laboratory experiments plus a study of natural history provided data on the pattern of pitch pine use during the life cycle of the gypsy moth, the effect of pitch pine on larval growth, and the differential impact of natural enemies depending on host use. I found that (1) egg masses occurred far more frequently on pitch pine than was expected based on the frequency of pitch pine in forests with low-density gypsy moth populations; (2) in the laboratory, early-instar larvae could not survive on pitch pine while late-instar larvae grew well; (3) in the field, larvae began to use pitch pine to feed and rest after the onset of the fourth instar. Compared to oak, (4) egg masses on pitch pine experienced less parasitism; (5) the microhabitat of pitch pine held less nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), a major mortality agent of the gypsy moth; (6) individuals hatching from eggs laid on pitch pine were less infected with NPV; and (7) larvae dosed with a known amount of NPV survived longer when feeding on pitch pine foliage. The use of pitch pine by individuals in low-density gypsy moth populations appeared to be beneficial and may have an important effect on population dynamics. The mobility associated with host switching by late-instar larvae and with dispersal by first-instar larvae oviposited on unacceptable food may represent an important mechanism for host-range extension.},

Immune defence is particularly relevant to survival in migratory bands, but little is known about the role of nutrition in insect immunocompetence. We hypothesised that immune defences are compromised in these migratory bands due to nutrient limitations. 2. In a migratory band in Utah, we investigated whether access to a protein relative to a carbohydrate diet would immediately reduce migratory activity, as had been shown for Mormon crickets in a previous study in Idaho, and whether the protein diet would enhance immune defence responses. 3. Radio-tracking Mormon crickets in the field, we found that locomotor activity was significantly and positively associated with body mass. Body mass-adjusted locomotor activity declined marginally following access to a protein diet, whereas spontaneous phenoloxidase (PO) activity was enhanced by the same diet. The encapsulation response and lysozyme-like activity were directly proportional to body mass, but unaffected by the dietary treatments in the short term. Within 6 h of feeding on protein or carbohydrates, Mormon crickets exhibited measurable effects on the immune system. 4. We conclude that nutrition impacts immune function in migrating insects in the field. Spontaneous PO activity may be limited by dietary deficiency in a protein-seeking band of Mormon crickets.},

abstract = {Mason, and Renate R. Bush ince 1868 or 1869, when it was in-troduced near Boston, the gypsy moth has been slowly expanding its range to include the entire northeast-ern United States and portions of Vir-ginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Michigan (Liebhold et al. 1992, 1996). It is inevitable that the gypsy moth will continue to spread south and west over the next century. The extent of gypsy moth defolia-tion has already been documented via aerial sketch mapping, among other techniques. This information has been used to map the distribution of forests susceptible to the gypsy moth within the infested region (Liebhold and Elk-inton 1989; Liebhold et al. 1994). To manage the gypsy moth over the next decade and beyond, however, foresters need to delimit the distribution of sus-ceptible stands in areas that • ' are not yet infested. The gypsy moth is a polyphagous insect; North American populations feed on more than 300 shrub and tree species (Leonard 1981; Liebhold et al. 1995). Despite this breadth of host prefer-ence, forests in the Northeast have var-ied considerably in their susceptibility to defoliation. We define susceptibility as the probability or frequency ofdefo-liation given an established gypsy moth population (Gottschalk 1993). Several studies have identified the characteristics of susceptible forests and yielded susceptibility models of varying levels of complexity. Probably the most important factor affecting stand susceptibility is the proportion of basal area represented by the gypsy moths preferred species (Herrick and Gansner 1986). Other variables, such as the predominance of chestnut oak, the abundance of bark flaps and other structural features of trees, and various i A gypsy moth infestation killed these oaks in south-central Pennsylvania in the 1980s. Such scenes may become common in the West and South as the gypsy moth, which feeds on many hosts, marches on. site characteristics, such as soils, have also been correlated with susceptibility (Bess et al. 1947; Valentine and Hous-ton 1979; Herrick and Gansner 1986). Use of these variables is often limited, however, because the correla-tions are specific to certain regions, or the variables are rarely measured in most forest inventories. Gansner et al. (1993) demon-strated how susceptibility models can be applied to {\_} forest inventory data to map forest susceptibility at the landscape level. Their analysis was applied to only a few mid-Atlantic states. In this study, we used a similar technique to map forest susceptibility over the conterminous United States.},

abstract = {From a regulatory perspective, Asian gypsy moth is a species complex consisting of three species of Lymantria and two subspecies of Lymantria dispar (L.), differing from the European subspecies, L. dispar dispar (L.), by hav-ing consistently flight-capable females. As such, the invasion potential in North America is thought to exceed that of European gypsy moth. USDA-APHIS therefore has a monitoring program to detect Asian gypsy moth at high-risk introduction pathways. Molecular markers are used to improve the diagnosis of Asian gypsy moth. One such marker, which targets the FS1 locus, detects an allele, FS1-A, prevalent in Asian populations but occurring at low frequencies (3–6{\%}) throughout the European gypsy moth's range in North America. However, some locales, such as Minnesota, exhibit elevated FS1-A frequencies. We studied the distribution of the FS1-A allele in northern Minnesota, 2013–2014, assessing spatial patterns in the distribution of the FS1-A allele using Moran's I and using spatial regression techniques to examine if the FS1-A allele was associated with putative movement pathways. We also used time series analysis to discern if temporal patterns in FS1-A or possible introduction events occurred. Our results indicated that FS1-A occurred randomly in space and time. We found no evidence that ele-vated FS1-A frequencies were associated with movement pathways or possible immigration events into this region over the two years. Elevated frequencies of the FS1-A allele within this region could be due to genetic drift and allelic surfing along the expanding population front, or to selection of physiological or behavioral traits.},

abstract = {Insects and other terrestrial arthropods are widely distributed in temperate and polar regions and overwinter in a variety of habitats. Some species are exposed to very low ambient temperatures, while others are protected by plant litter and snow. As may be expected from the enormous diversity of terrestrial arthropods, many different overwintering strategies have evolved. Time is an im­ portant factor. Temperate and polar species are able to survive extended periods at freezing temperatures, while summer adapted species and tropical species may be killed by short periods even above the freezing point. Some insects survive extracellular ice formation, while most species, as well as all spiders, mites and springtails are freeze intoler­ ant and depend on supercooling to survive. Both the degree of freeze tolerance and supercooling increase by the accumulation of low molecular weight cryoprotectant substances, e.g. glycerol. Thermal hysteresis proteins (antifreeze proteins) stabilise the supercooled state of insects and may prevent the inoculation of ice from outside through the cuticle. Recently, the amino acid sequences of these proteins have been revealed. Due to potent ice nucleating agents in the haemolymph most freeze tolerant insects freeze at relatively high temperatures, thus preventing harmful effects of intracellular freezing. Due to the low water vapour pressure in frozen environments, supercooled terrestrial arthropods are at a risk of desiccation. Glyc­ erol and other low molecular weight substances may protect against dehydration as well as against cold. In the arctic springtail Ony-chiurus arcticus, freezing is avoided due to dehydration in equilibrium with the ambient freezing temperature. In some frozen habitats terrestrial arthropods are enclosed by ice and survive an oxygen deficiency by anaerobic metabolism. Suggestions for further research include investigating the nature of freeze tolerance, the physiology of prolonged exposures to cold, and the relation between desiccation, anaerobiosis and cold hardiness.},

All are colonial during the larval stage, but M. disstria differs from the others in one respect: it does not construct a communal tent. This difference in habit merits special consideration in any comparative study of larval behaviour, particularly in one concerned with the effects of physical factors upon the insects, since a tent modifies the effects of the physical environment considerably. Recently, a series of such studies was carried out, and one part of the work consisted of laboratory and field observations on the light reactions of larvae. The results obtained have raised a number of new questions which unfortunately cannot be answered now, hecause two of the species have been difficult to obtain in quantity since 1950. Nevertheless, the findings are presented here without additional delay, since they are of general interest, and other workers may wish to use them.},

Egg mass characteristics are valuable indices of population quality as well as future population levels. Laboratory crowding reduced number of eggs/mass but did not affect egg size. Field collected egg masses from various population levels in Massachusetts also varied in egg number/mass, but egg size could not be directly correlated to density. Laboratory rearing of larvae on several natural diets produced differences in both egg number and size. Maple diets produced egg masses with fewer, smaller eggs, as compared with oak diets. Field collected egg masses also varied in mean egg size, according to host tree species. Thus, forest composition may directly affect the quality of gypsy moth populations, as well as numerical levels. Increasing density could affect egg size indirectly, by forcing gypsy moth larvae to feed on unfavorable host foliage.},

abstract = {Pathogens are the number one cause of impairments of assessed rivers and streams in the USA and pose a significant human health hazard. The Dry Run Creek Watershed in Northeast Iowa has been designated as impaired by the State of Iowa because of high levels of Escherichia coli bacteria. To investigate the nature of this impairment, land use and stream bank assessments were coupled with comprehensive water quality monitoring. Physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured at 13 different sites in the watershed, including pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia-N, nitrate + nitrite-N, total phosphorus, and E. coli. In addition, benthic macroinvertebrate communities were analyzed at seven sites, and optical brightener tests were performed late in the season. Results identified segments of the watershed that were more prominent contributors of E. coli, and correlations were observed between levels of E. coli and several chemical parameters, including ammonia-N, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Interestingly, distinct sites emerged as more prominent contributors of these elements during rain vs. non-rain events, suggesting different types of sources. Both the amount of rainfall and the time elapsed between the rain event and the sampling influenced E. coli levels during wet weather conditions. Nitrate + nitrite-N displayed a unique response to rain events compared with the other parameters, suggesting a different delivery route. Analyses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities were consistent with pollution trends. Collectively, these data suggest distinct agriculturally related E. coli contributions, as well as specific areas and practices for water quality improvement strategies. This study can serve as a resource for evaluating agricultural watersheds that are impaired for bacteria.},

abstract = {It has often been stated that insects survive at low temperature by one of two main strategies, freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance by supercooling. Apart from the observation that the risk of freezing and its consequences is not the only injurious and possibly lethal effect of low temperature, it is interesting to consider a closely related question. If insects survive at low temperature by tolerating or avoiding freezing, under what circumstances do they die? A survey of the literature suggests there are five reasonably distinct situations representing decreasing levels of cold tolerance where death occurs (1) at some temperature below the freezing temperature or supercooling point (SCP), (2) when the organism freezes, (3) after prolonged chilling at moderate to low sub-zero temperatures, (4) after brief chilling at moderate to high sub-zero temperatures and (5) when temperatures are too low to maintain normal metabolism and the species is unable to enter any form of dormant state. This paper examines how the principles of freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance, derived primarily from studies on species from extreme environments, can be combined with observations on the cold tolerance of insects from less severe climatic zones, to produce a system of classification which allocates species to particular categories, using specific, ecologically-relevant criteria. The proposed new classes of cold hardy insects - freeze tolerant, freeze avoiding, chill tolerant, chill susceptible and opportunistic survival - thus form a continuum of distinct groups, from the most to least cold hardy, in a system of classifying insect cold hardiness that can be applied world-wide.},

abstract = {This paper develops a procedure for quantify-ing movement sequences in terms of move length and turning angle probability distributions. By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displace-ment formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Obser-vations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circum-stances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these ex-amples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes. 1969). Alternatively, much progress has also been made by describing movement with analytical models that rely on the assumption of random motion (see especially, the pioneering work of Broadbent and Kendall 1953; Skellam 1951). In this paper, we extend an earlier formula concerning discrete random walks (see appendix of Jones 1977) and develop an analytic expression for net displace-ment in a correlated random walk. The formula that we develop fills a gap somewhere between the powerful general diffusion models of Skellam (1951) and the realistic detailed simulations of Jones (1977). One of the advantages of our approach is that it produces a summary of behavior that enables compari-sons to be made between different organisms, or for the same organism in different situations. In particular, by making the assumption of correlated random movement, we derive a formula for expected net displacement in terms of easily observed distance and directionality parameters. This formula can serve as a means for exploring the consequences of varying rules of movement. We illustrate the approach by applying it to two examples of insect movement.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. ABSTRACT. This paper considers two alternative hypotheses for explaining biological invasions. One hypothesis, currently prevalent in ecology, is based on the assumption that a 'balance of nature' exists and that biologically functional interactions dominate all other factors. An alternative hypothesis assumes that species are independent and respond individualistically to all factors, their individualism depending on species-specific responses relative to particular factors. The first hypothesis views community composition and external environmental factors as stable; invasions occur either when community resistance ('inertia') is overcome, or when species change genetically so that they can colonize new climatic or biotic environments. The second hypothesis views community composi-tion as flexible and external factors as dynamic. The first is often described using deterministic models, whereas the second emphasizes stochastic ones. After briefly surveying theories concerning the 'balance of nature', I describe a stochastic model of range structure and extend it to invasions. This is illustrated by the invasion of the collared dove, Streptopelia decaocto (Friv.), into Europe.},

Late in the last larval instar, a sparse cocoon is constructed. When larvae are starved, a shift in behavior is noted, with increased locomotion, irritability, and the trailing of a strand of silk as larvae wander. First-instar larvae, quiescent and anchored on resting mats, are not readily induced to spin down on silk threads; hence are not readily dispersed by wind. Hungry first-instar larvae, more apt to be spinning down, are presumed to be more readily dispersed by wind. Larvae which undergo an additional instar have a longer prefeeding phase and might be more readily dispersed than "normal' larvae. The effects of hunger may also cause the shift in diel periodicity of mid- and late-instar larvae, resulting in some dispersal of these larvae away from areas where food will be depleted.},

Here we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment. Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42-115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods, between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators.},

Mating failure is a typical cause of Allee effects in low-density insect populations, and dispersion of individuals in space and time can exacerbate mate-location failure in invading populations. 3. Here we evaluate the relative importance of dispersal and sexual asynchrony as contributors to Allee effects in invading populations by adopting as a case study the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.), an important insect defoliator for which considerable demographic information is available. 4. We used release-recapture experiments to parameterize a model that describes probabilities that males locate females along various spatial and temporal offsets between male and female adult emergence. 5. Based on these experimental results, we developed a generalized model of mating success that demonstrates the existence of an Allee threshold, below which introduced gypsy moth populations are likely to go extinct without any management intervention.},

abstract = {North American gypsy moths disperse as newly hatched larvae on wind currents in a behavior called ballooning. Because ballooning occurs before neonates begin to feed, resources used in dispersal are limited to those carried over from the egg. We show that nutritional experience of the maternal parent can influence the tendency of offspring to disperse, and that resource provisioning of eggs by the maternal parent affects the duration of the window for dispersal. Offspring of females from defoliated sites had a lower tendency to balloon in a wind tunnel than larvae from females which had not experienced nutritional stress associated with host defoliation. The number of eggs in an egg mass, a reflection of the maternal parent's nutritional experience, also contributed to the predictive model for dispersal that included defoliation level. Egg weight and the levels of two yolk proteins, vitellin (Vt) and glycine-rich protein (CRP), however, had no influence on the proportion of ballooning larvae. The length of survival without food, and thus the maximum period of time for dispersal, was correlated with levels of Vt and GRP, but not with egg weight. The level of defoliation at the site from which the maternal parent was collected was not related to the longevity of offspring, nor did it have a significant effect on the levels of Vt, GRP or egg weight. Levels of hemo-lymph proteins arylphorin and vitellogenin in the maternal parent during the prepupal stage had no influence on levels of yolk proteins, larval longevity, or tendency to balloon.},
annote = {-first star ballooning is the primary mode of dispersal
-to balloon, they need energy. It must happen before first feeding, so the energy comes from maternal nutrients in egg
-egg weight and size are not necessarily good predictors of organism survival - levels of protein within egg may be better
-potential for dispersal by gypsy moth is product of tendency to balloon and length of period in which ballooning can happen (more likely to balloon -{\textgreater} more dispersal, longer balloon window --{\textgreater} more dispersal)
- potential to balloon was associated with maternal stress - the more stressed, the less likely they were to balloon
-length of prefeeding was associated with amount of egg protein (but not weight or size) - the more protein, the longer the prefeeding period},

abstract = {Larvae of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) are a major pest of vine, Vitis vinifera. As larvae have limited energy reserves and are in danger of desiccation and predation an efficient response to plant volatiles that would guide them to food and shelter could be expected. The responses of starved 2nd or 3rd instar larvae to volatile emissions from their artificial diet and to single host plant volatiles were recorded on a locomotion compensator. Test products were added to an air stream passing over the 30 cm diameter servosphere. The larvae showed non-directed walks of low rectitude in the air stream alone but changed to goal-oriented upwind displacement characterised by relatively straight tracks when the odour of the artificial diet and vapours of methyl salicylate, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, terpinen-4-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were added to the air stream. This chemoanemotactic targeted displacement illustrates appetence for certain volatile cues from food by starved Lobesia larvae. Analysis of the larval behaviour indicates dose dependent responses to some of the host plant volatiles tested with a response to methyl salicylate already visible at 1 ng, the lowest source dose tested. These behavioural responses show that Lobesia larvae can efficiently locate mixtures of volatile products released by food sources as well as single volatile constituents of their host plants. Such goal-oriented responses with shorter travel time and reduced energy loss are probably of importance for larval survival as it decreases the time they are exposed to biotic and abiotic hazards. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Records accumulated between 1911 and 1931 from a series of plots in eastern New England were analyzed to determine some of the changes in the forest that followed heavy and repeated defoliation by the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.). Oak trees required about 10 years to recover totally from a single heavy defoliation. Dominant trees were degraded less than subdominants and were less likely to die. Trees rated in poor condition were more likely to die after defoliation than those rated good. Tree species not favored as food by the insects were more likely to die after heavy defoliation than oak trees. Red maple, Acer rubrum (L.), was more likely to be killed by one heavy defoliation than white pine, Pinus strobus (L.). When defoliation, overall, was low, nearly all of it occurred on favored-food trees, but the insects became less selective as overall defoliation increased. Heavy and repeated defoliation resulted in more and more one-storied stands. For two reasons, heavy defoliation and subsequent tree mortality tended to reduce the susceptibility of the residual stand to further defoliation. First, differential loss rates among favored- and nonfavored-food species tended to alter forest composition toward less-susceptible types. Second, certain trees within any given tree species were consistently defoliated more heavily than others. These trees were also more likely to die.},

Dendroctonus rufipennis, a serious insect pest causing periodic widespread damage to mature white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stands in Alaska, was studied to determine if either larvae or adults were freezing-tolerant. Mean supercooling points in both larvae and adults dropped from -12°C in summer to about -3 1°C in winter. The decrease in supercooling points in larvae was closely associated with synthesis of glycerol, but the decline in adult supercooling points partially preceded the synthesis of glycerol in the fall. Winter glycerol levels reached 3 molal. Neither larvae nor adults were freezing-tolerant at any time of the year.

Plants produce a diversity of defense compounds that affect the ability of herbivores to utilize these strategies in response to variation in food nutritional quality. Little is known, however, about effects of allelochemicals on herbivores utilizing integrated behavioral and morphological responses to reduced food quality. Our objectives were to (1) examine how variation in diet nutritional quality influences compensatory responses of a generalist insect herbivore, and (2) determine how plant defenses affect these processes. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae were administered one of nine combinations of diet having low, moderate, or high nutritional quality and 0, 2, or 4 {\%} purified aspen (Populus tremuloides) salicinoids. We quantified larval growth, consumption, frass production, and biomass allocation to midgut tissue over a 4-day bioassay. In the absence of salicinoids, larvae compensated for reduced nutritional quality and maintained similar growth across all diets through increased consumption, altered midgut biomass allocation, and improved processing efficiencies. Dietary salicinoids reduced larval consumption, midgut biomass allocation, digestive efficiencies, and growth at all nutritional levels, but the effect size was more pronounced when larvae were fed nutritionally suboptimal diets. Our findings demonstrate that integrated behavioral and morphological compensatory responses to reduced food quality are affected by plant defenses, ultimately limiting compensatory responses and reducing larval performance.},

abstract = {s Abstract Ideally, integrated pest management should rely on an array of tactics. In reality, the main technologies in use are synthetic pesticides. Because of well-documented problems with reliance on synthetic pesticides, viable alternatives are sorely needed. Physical controls can be classified as passive (e.g., trenches, fences, organic mulch, particle films, inert dusts, and oils), active (e.g., mechanical, polish-ing, pneumatic, impact, and thermal), and miscellaneous (e.g., cold storage, heated air, flaming, hot-water immersion). Some physical methods such as oils have been used successfully for preharvest treatments for decades. Another recently developed method for preharvest situations is particle films. As we move from production to the consumer, legal constraints restrict the number of options available. Consequently, several physical control methods are used in postharvest situations. Two noteworthy examples are the entoleter, an impacting machine used to crush all insect stages in flour, and hot-water immersion of mangoes, used to kill tephritid fruit fly immatures in fruit. The future of physical control methods will be influenced by sociolegal issues and by new developments in basic and applied research.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. The locomotor activity of the lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata bruckii Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), was recorded during food deprivation in LD 16:8 h and continuous light. Activity was relatively low immediately after the lady beetle was fed to satiation but increased from 4 to 24 h later. It thereafter gradually decreased to a low level when the food was withheld for several days. Over a period of 10 days of starvation the beetles showed a high level of activity throughout the photophase and a low level during the scotophase in LD 16:8 h. In continuous light this rhythmic pattern persisted, with a free-running period of c. 22 h, significantly shorter than 24 h. The results suggest that the endogenous circadian timing predominates over ‘hunger' as a determinant of search activity. The lady beetle accepted and consumed aphid prey presented at night, but the number of prey consumed was significantly lower than in the light. This suggests that, during the dark, activity related to prey-searching is suppressed, though lady beetles are able to accept and consume prey even at night.},

abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

abstract = {Implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) is by definition scale- and location-specific and because these features govern biophysical processes such as dispersal, information on the latter is relevant for IPM. However, dispersal has not featured prominently as the defining and critical element of IPM schemes. At the larger regional or inter-continental scales then our understanding of dispersal has improved with the availability of new tracking technologies (e.g., Doppler weather radar, see Westbrook and Isard (1999)), but proportionate returns in terms of IPM have not been demonstrated. There is increasing interest in describing within-field and within-plant dispersal events, but much remains to be done to integrate research findings into operational IPM programmes. Models are often seen as useful tools for analysing pest and disease outbreaks and for the evaluation of alternative control options. Dispersal, in full biophysical detail, has rarely featured explicitly in such models, and indeed the lack of biological balance in complex simulation models places their uses in research, technology development or implementation somewhat in doubt. Often, however, it is possible to incorporate dispersal or more generally spatial processes into simplified models that combine applicability to real pest management situations with the insights of theoretical population ecology. Such insights are relevant to the multiple-species interactions characteristic of biological control and the ways in which dispersal affects the qualitative attributes of these interactions. Dispersal research has had a demonstrable impact on pest management and new opportunities will arise in the future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The insect exoskeleton provides shape, waterproofing, and locomotion via attached somatic muscles. The exoskeleton is renewed during molting, a process regulated by ecdysteroid hormones. The holometabolous pupa transforms into an adult during the imaginal molt, when the epidermis synthe3sizes the definitive exoskeleton that then differentiates progressively. An important issue in insect development concerns how the exoskeletal regions are constructed to provide their morphological, physiological and mechanical functions. We used whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays to screen for genes involved in exoskeletal formation in the honeybee thoracic dorsum. Our analysis included three sampling times during the pupal-to-adult molt, i.e., before, during and after the ecdysteroid-induced apolysis that triggers synthesis of the adult exoskeleton.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Gene ontology annotation based on orthologous relationships with Drosophila melanogaster genes placed the honeybee differentially expressed genes (DEGs) into distinct categories of Biological Process and Molecular Function, depending on developmental time, revealing the functional elements required for adult exoskeleton formation. Of the 1,253 unique DEGs, 547 were upregulated in the thoracic dorsum after apolysis, suggesting induction by the ecdysteroid pulse. The upregulated gene set included 20 of the 47 cuticular protein (CP) genes that were previously identified in the honeybee genome, and three novel putative CP genes that do not belong to a known CP family. In situ hybridization showed that two of the novel genes were abundantly expressed in the epidermis during adult exoskeleton formation, strongly implicating them as genuine CP genes. Conserved sequence motifs identified the CP genes as members of the CPR, Tweedle, Apidermin, CPF, CPLCP1 and Analogous-to-Peritrophins families. Furthermore, 28 of the 36 muscle-related DEGs were upregulated during the de novo formation of striated fibers attached to the exoskeleton. A search for cis-regulatory motifs in the 5'-untranslated region of the DEGs revealed potential binding sites for known transcription factors. Construction of a regulatory network showed that various upregulated CP- and muscle-related genes (15 and 21 genes, respectively) share common elements, suggesting co-regulation during thoracic exoskeleton formation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings help reveal molecular aspects of rigid thoracic exoskeleton formation during the ecdysteroid-coordinated pupal-to-adult molt in the honeybee.},

abstract = {Many defoliating forest lepidopterans cause predictable periodic deforestation. Several of these species exhibit geographical variation in both the strength of periodic behavior and the frequency of cycles. The mathematical models used to describe the population dynamics of such species commonly predict that gradual variation in the underlying ecological mechanisms may lead to punctuated (subharmonic) variation in outbreak cycles through period-doubling cascades. Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, in its recently established range in the northeastern United States may represent an unusually clear natural manifestation of this phenomenon. In this study we introduce a new statistical spatial-smoothing method for estimating outbreak periodicity from space-time defoliation data collected with spatial error. The method statistically confirms the existence of subharmonic variation in cyclicity among different forest types. Some xeric forest types exhibit a statistical 4-5 year period in outbreak dynamics, some mesic forest types a 9-10 year period, and some intermediate forest types a dominant 9-10 year period with a 4-5 year subdominant superharmonic. We then use a theoretical model involving gypsy moth, pathogens, and predators to investigate the possible role of geographical variation in generalist predator populations as the cause of this variation in dynamics. The model predicts that the period of gypsy moth oscillations should be positively associated with predator carrying capacity and that variation in the carrying capacity provides a parsimonious explanation of previous reports of geographical variation in gypsy moth periodicity. Furthermore, a two-patch spatial extension of the model shows that, in the presence of spatial coupling, subharmonic attractors can coexist whereas nonharmonic attractors (i.e., where the cycle lengths are not integer multiples of one another) cannot.},

abstract = {From the available experimental data a relatively clear picture can be established with regard to the physiological importance of some of the mechanisms involved in insect cold hardening. In freeze-avoiding insects, all potent ice-nucleating agents are removed or inactivated, leading to a depression of the supercooling points to about 20 degrees C. Accumulation of polyols causes a further depression with a magnitude of about twice the corresponding melting-point depression. Production of thermal hysteresis factors causes a stabilization of the supercooled state. In freeze-tolerant insects, potent ice-nucleating agents are produced in the extracellular body fluid, ensuring a protective extracellular freezing at a few degrees below zero. Accumulation of polyols causes a steep drop in the lethal temperature, due to a reduction of the amount of ice by a colligative mechanism. However, there is still much to be learned about the mechanisms by which ice-nucleating agents, polyols, and thermal hysteresis agents are acting. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the production and elimination of these components from the body fluid of the insects are not understood. Also, when it comes to the influence of environmental factors, like photoperiod and temperature, there is much to be learned. In addition to giving attention to these topics, future research should be focused on the possible role of other factors in cold hardening such as bound water, dehydration, low-molecular-weight solutes other than polyols, and the biochemical mechanisms forming the basis of the seasonal changes in the cold hardiness of insects.},

With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

Emerald ash borer was first detected in Maryland in 2003, and the biological control program to manage this beetle in Maryland was initiated in 2009. Here we examine the establishment and abundance of two introduced parasitoids of EAB larvae (Spathius agrili Yang and Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang). Overall, 56,677 S. agrili and 191,506 T. planipennisi were released at 26 and 32 sites, respectively, from 2009 to 2014. Monitoring parasitoids involved debarking trees, and harvesting trees to place in rearing barrels, and was conducted at 47 sites (23 of which received parasitoids, and 24 of which served as controls) from 2010 to 2015. We recovered 77 S. agrili from 16 EAB larvae at six sites, and 1856 T. planipennisi from 110 EAB larvae at 19 sites. Percentage parasitism by T. planipennisi, and the mean percentage of trees containing T. planipennisi broods, were positively associated with the number of years post-release of the parasitoids (reaching 11.6{\%} and 41.7{\%} four years post-release, respectively). The relationship between T. planipennisi parasitism and tree size was best described by an exponential decrease model, with over 95{\%} of parasitism occurring in trees with a diameter at breast height of {\textless}16 cm. In conclusion, T. planipennisi has established populations and dispersed in Maryland, while S. agrili releases have been largely unsuccessful. These findings are a step towards optimizing EAB biological control release and recovery strategies, and are particularly pertinent for other states in the Mid-Atlantic region.},

abstract = {The selection of a distributional assumption suitable for modelling macroinvertebrate density data is typically challenging. Macroinvertebrate data often exhibit substantially larger variances than expected under a standard count assumption, that of the Poisson distribution. Such overdispersion may derive from multiple sources, including heterogeneity of habitat (historically and spatially), differing life histories for organisms collected within a single collection in space and time, and autocorrelation. Taken to extreme, heterogeneity of habitat may be argued to explain the frequent large proportions of zero observations in macroinvertebrate data. Sampling locations may consist of habitats defined qualitatively as either suitable or unsuitable. The former category may yield random or stochastic zeroes and the latter structural zeroes. Heterogeneity among counts may be accommodated by treating the count mean itself as a random variable, while extra zeroes may be accommodated using zero-modified count assumptions, including zero-inflated and two-stage (or hurdle) approaches. These and linear assumptions (following log- and square root-transformations) were evaluated using 9 years of mayfly density data from a 52 km, ninth-order reach of the Upper Mississippi River (n = 959). The data exhibited substantial overdispersion relative to that expected under a Poisson assumption (i.e. variance:mean ratio = 23 ≫ 1), and 43{\%} of the sampling locations yielded zero mayflies. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), count models were improved most by treating the count mean as a random variable (via a Poisson-gamma distributional assumption) and secondarily by zero modification (i.e. improvements in AIC values = 9184 units and 47-48 units, respectively). Zeroes were underestimated by the Poisson, log-transform and square root-transform models, slightly by the standard negative binomial model but not by the zero-modified models (61{\%}, 24{\%}, 32{\%}, 7{\%}, and 0{\%}, respectively). However, the zero-modified Poisson models underestimated small counts (1 ≤ y ≤ 4) and overestimated intermediate counts (7 ≤ y ≤ 23). Counts greater than zero were estimated well by zero-modified negative binomial models, while counts greater than one were also estimated well by the standard negative binomial model. Based on AIC and percent zero estimation criteria, the two-stage and zero-inflated models performed similarly. The above inferences were largely confirmed when the models were used to predict values from a separate, evaluation data set (n = 110). An exception was that, using the evaluation data set, the standard negative binomial model appeared superior to its zero-modified counterparts using the AIC (but not percent zero criteria). This and other evidence suggest that a negative binomial distributional assumption should be routinely considered when modelling benthic macroinvertebrate data from low flow environments. Whether negative binomial models should themselves be routinely examined for extra zeroes requires, from a statistical perspective, more investigation. However, this question may best be answered by ecological arguments that may be specific to the sampled species and locations. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stimuli from a broad spectrum of sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, thermal, and chemical, can elicit walking responses in animals, reflecting neural activity in sensorimotor pathways. We have developed an integrated walking measurement system with sub-millisecond temporal accuracy capable of detecting position changes on the order of 100$\mu$m. This tracking system provides the experimenter with a means by which to map out the response spectrum of a tethered animal to any number of sensory inputs on time scales relevant to propagation in the nervous system. The data acquisition system consists of a modified optical computer mouse, a microcontroller with peripheral support circuitry, a binary stimulus sync line, and a serial (RS-232) data transfer interface. The entire system is constructed of relatively inexpensive components mostly converted from commercially available peripheral devices. We have acquired walking data synchronized with auditory stimuli at rates in excess of 2100 samples per second while applying this system to the walking phonotactic response of the parasitic fly Ormia ochracea.},

Smith) and Estigmene congrua Walk. were studied in the field and laboratory in an attempt to understand factors determining foraging behaviour. 2. Tracks were recorded on artificial substrates indoors, in the open, and in the normal habitat under the following conditions: in darkness, in bright sunlight, under heavy overcast, under blue sky with the substrate intermit- tently rotated, with an overhead sheet of Polaroid rotated, on a substrate with asperities, in natural field conditions with a variety of forbs in dis- persed and clumped distributions. 3. Tortuosity and general directions of paths were analysed. 4. The effects of various levels of deprivation were also analysed. 5. In the absence of photic and chemical stimulation paths on smooth surfaces are straight and direction is random. 6. Obstacles perturb the paths and impart a meandering pattern. Pat- terns of locomotion induced by obstacles on a smooth substrate are indis- tinguishable from patterns of locomotion in the field. Unless food plants are closer than 1cm they have no effect on locomotion. Patterns of locomo- tion in dispersed and clumped foodplants are the same. 7. What appears to be food-related search behaviour is primarily the re- sult of physical features of the environment perturbing a central neuronal pattern of locomotion. Stimuli from foodplants appear to be irrelevant un- less actually enountered.},

It refers to a standpoint regarding both: a cluster of statistical tools, their interpretation and justification; and a general philosophy of science, and the roles probability plays in inductive inference. Comparison of error statistical approach to other philosophies of statistics requires understanding the complex interconnections between the methodological and philosophical dimensions. This chapter focuses on the error statistical philosophy and concerns the interplay between the philosophical, methodological, and statistical issues, to elucidate long-standing conceptual, technical, and epistemological debates surrounding both dimensions. Standard explications of statistical methods focus on the formal mathematical tools without considering a general philosophy of science or of induction in which these tools best fit. Finally, this chapter deals with statistical methods of testing and estimation while simultaneously highlighting classic misunderstandings and fallacies. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Little information about A. planipennis is available from its native range and it was not known whether this invasive pest would exhibit a preference for a particular North American ash species. We monitored A. planipennis density and canopy condition on green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) street trees in four neighbor- hoods and on white and blue ash (F. quadrangulata) trees in two woodlots in southeast Michigan. Green ash street trees had significantly more canopy dieback and higher A. planipennis densities than white ash trees growing in the same neighborhood. Density increased by two- to fourfold in both species over a 3-year period. Canopy dieback increased linearly from 2002 to 2005 as A. planipennis density increased (R2 ? 0.70). In each of the woodlots, A. planipennis densities were significantly higher on white ash trees than blue ash trees. Woodpecker predation occurred in all sites and accounted for 35{\%} of the A. planipennis that developed on trees we surveyed. Results indicate that surveys for A. planipennis},

The discussion includes optical sensors and insect trapping, instrumented beehives, acoustic detection of insects in grain, fruit and soil, and various laboratory methods for studying insect movement, such as actographs, treadmills, automatic flight mills, and the video recording and analysis of movement in wind tunnels and in indoor arenas. Airborne and satellite imaging of insect habitats is mentioned, but only in the context of the use of these techniques to deduce changes in population distribution in some migratory species.

However, in laboratory studies large larvae (from large eggs) disperse more frequently than small larvae (from small eggs) in the presence of favored food. Large larvae may be better adapted for dispersal. When larvae encounter unacceptable food or are denied food, larvae disperse more frequently and dispersal by small larvae is nearly as frequent as dispersal by large larvae. Factors affecting egg size may contribute to shifts in dispersal patterns of gypsy moth larvae and distribution of populations.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a novel unfixed-type experimental system that we call a '3-DOF servosphere.' This system comprises one sphere and three omniwheels that support the sphere. The measurement method is very simple. An experimental animal is placed on top of the sphere. The position and heading angle of the animal are observed by using a high-speed camera installed above the sphere. Because the system can rotate the sphere with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) independently, the position and heading angle at the origin can be maintained without fixing the body. This system can be used to measure an animal's natural behavior while simultaneously providing it with precise stimuli. Moreover, electrodes can be inserted at specific sites to measure biosignals with locomotion. Therefore, this system can simultaneously measure the stimulus input-internal state-locomotion output of an animal. In this study, we focused on the chemical plume tracing (CPT) behavior of the Bombyx mori male silkworm moth in order to identify its CPT algorithm for mounting on a robot. In an experiment, we simultaneously measured the stimulus input, flight muscle electromyogram (EMG), and CPT behavior by using the 3-DOF servosphere to verify the system. We elucidated the relationship between the CPT behavior and flight muscle EMG.},

Invasion ecologists have focused on the disease risks to native communities through ‘‘spillover'' of infectious agents introduced with nonindigenous hosts, while overlooking a potentially more common mechanism of impact, that of ‘‘parasite spillback.'' We hypothesize that parasite spillback could occur when a nonindigenous species is a competent host for a native parasite, with the presence of the additional host increasing disease impacts in native species. Despite its lack of formalization in all recent reviews of the role of parasites in species introductions, aspects of the invasion process actually favor parasite spillback over spillover.Wespecifically review the animal-parasite literature and show that native species (arthropods, parasitoids, protozoa, and helminths) account for 67{\%} of the parasite fauna of nonindigenous animals from a range of taxonomic groups. Weshow that nonindigenous species can be highly competent hosts for such parasites and provide evidence that infection by native parasites does spillback from nonindigenous species to native host species, with effects at both the host individual and population scale. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of parasite spillback as a potential threat to native species, discuss possible reasons for its neglect by invasion ecologists, and identify future research directions.},

abstract = {Despite their common use as model organisms in scientific experiments, pain and suffering in insects remains controversial and poorly understood. Here we explore potential pain experience in honeybees (Apis mellifera) by testing the self-administration of an analgesic drug. Foragers were subjected to two different types of injuries: (i) a clip that applied continuous pressure to one leg and (ii) amputation of one tarsus. The bees were given a choice between two feeders, one offering pure sucrose solution, the other sucrose solution plus morphine. We found that sustained pinching had no effect on the amount of morphine consumed, and hence is unlikely to be experienced as painful. The amputated bees did not shift their relative preference towards the analgesic either, but consumed more morphine and more solution in total compared to intact controls. While our data do not provide evidence for the self-administration of morphine in response to pain, they suggest that injured bees increase their overall food intake, presumably to meet the increased energy requirements for an immune response caused by wounding. We conclude that further experiments are required to gain insights into potential pain-like states in honeybees and other insects.},

abstract = {Many animals rely on chemical cues to recognize and locate a resource, and they must extract the relevant information from a complex and changing odor environment. For example, in moths, finding a mate is mediated by a sex pheromone, which is detected in a rich environment of volatile plant compounds. Here, we investigated the effects of a volatile plant background on the walking response of male Spodoptera littoralis to the female pheromone. Males were stimulated by combining pheromone with one of three plant compounds, and their walking paths were recorded with a locomotion compensator and analyzed. We found that the addition of certain volatile plant compounds disturbed the orientation toward the sex pheromone. The effect on locomotion was correlated with the capacity of the plant compound to antagonize pheromone detection by olfactory receptor neurons, suggesting a masking effect of the background over the pheromone signal. Moths were more sensitive to changes in background compared to a constant background, suggesting that a background odor also acts as a distracting stimulus. Our experiments show that the effects of odorant background on insect responses to chemical signals are complex and cannot be explained by a single mechanism.},

abstract = {Allee effects have been applied historically in efforts to understand the low-density population dynamics of rare and endangered species. Many biological invasions likewise experience the phenomenon of decreasing population growth rates at low population densities because most founding populations of introduced nonnative species occur at low densities. In range expansion of established species, the initial colonizers of habitat beyond the organism's current range are usually at low density, and thus could be subject to Allee dynamics. There has been consistent empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrating, and in some cases quantifying, the role of Allee dynamics in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), invasion of North America. In this review, we examine the potential causes of the Allee effect in the gypsy moth and highlight the importance of mate-finding failure as a primary mechanism behind an Allee effect, while the degree to which generalist predators induce an Allee effect remains unclear. We then explore the role of Allee effects in the establishment and spread dynamics of the gypsy moth system, which conceptually could serve as a model system for understanding how Allee effects manifest themselves in the dynamics of biological invasions.},

abstract = {When theory predicts which phenotypes are well adapted to a given environment, the data do not always match the predictions. Host-plant selection by herbivorous insects is one such example. Herbivorous insects often appear to make poor choices about where their offspring should develop. New evidence presented by Scheirs et al. suggests that adult insects can choose oviposition sites that enhance their own long-term fitness at the expense of their individual offspring. This suggests that herbivorous insects might be genuinely bad mothers, that host choice is nonetheless adaptive, and that theory needs to incorporate new assumptions about host effects on adult performance.},

abstract = {Avian biologists routinely estimate sampling variance for parameter estimates such as daily nest survival, fecundity, annual survival, and density. However, many biologists are not certain of methods to derive sampling variance for parameters when survival rates change temporal scales. Similar methods are needed to obtain sampling variance when biologists combine parameter estimates to calculate an indirect demographic parameter, such as population growth rate. The delta method is a useful technique for approximating sampling variance when the desired demographic parameter is a function of at least one other demographic parameter. However, the delta method is rarely taught in most graduate-level biology or ecology courses, and application of this method may be discouraged by seemingly daunting formulas in reference books. Here, I provide five examples of sampling variance approximations for common situations encountered by avian ecologists, with step-by-step explanations of the equations involved.},

A transient heat transfer equation was used to design polystyrene cubes of different sizes to yield constant rates of cooling at their centers when held at a constant surrounding temperature. Cubes of 0.29 x 0.29 x 0.29 m and 0.19 x 0.19 x 0.19 m were found to produce cooling rates of about -0.5 and -1 degree C per min, respectively, from 0 to -40 degree C. The observed temperature variations at the geometrical center of the cubes were similar to those predicted by the equation. Temperature plots showed a nearly constant rate of cooling. Supercooling points of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) at different stages of development were recorded using polystyrene cubes. These SCPs compared favorably with published values. This method of obtaining cooling rates is economical, flexible, and allows for multiple simultaneous SCP measurements.},

abstract = {To examine how resource distributions affect the movement behaviors of fed and food-deprived Eleodes extricata Say darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), we experimentally manipulated the dispersion of food to create clumped, random, and uniform distributions in an otherwise homogeneous 25-m(2) experimental field landscape. Quantitative measures of the tortuosity, net linear displacement, overall path length, and velocity of beetle movement pathways showed that food-deprived beetles generally moved more slowly and over shorter distances than did fed beetles. This effect was mediated by the spatial distribution of food, however; food distributed randomly over the landscape evoked more tortuous paths over larger overall distances. The foraging movements of food-deprived beetles were most different from those of fed individuals in treatments with randomly distributed food resources. These results show that the influence of spatial structure on individuals depends not only on the arrangement of pattern but also on the function that the structure plays. Thus, 'spatial structure' is defined not only by physical characteristics of the landscape but also by how that structure is used by animals.},

abstract = {1. Most research on host selection by arthropods is based on optimal oviposition theory. This theory, also called the oviposition preference-offspring performance hypothesis, predicts that a female will choose those hosts for oviposition on which larvae perform best. Recent studies suggested, however, that optimal foraging by adults, or the quality of the host for adult performance, might also influence host choice. 2. This study investigated whether host preference of the polyphagous leafminer Liriomyza trifolii is determined by optimal foraging and/or optimal oviposition. 3. Female realised fecundity correlated nearly perfectly with feeding and oviposition preference of L. trifolii. The relationships between host preference and the offspring performance measures were always weaker. Hosts optimal for adult nutrition were also optimal for offspring performance but not vice versa. Hence, it was concluded that optimal foraging shapes feeding and oviposition preference of L. trifolii as this is the best strategy in order to maximise female fitness.},

When larvae were allowed to choose among the foliage of live seedlings of the same species, they preferred B. papyrifera (71.0{\%}) over A. saccharum (14.3{\%}) and F. pennsylvanica (0.7{\%}). Trunk sections of A. saccharum and B. papyrifera were wrapped around live seedlings of the same trees and F. pennsylvanica in six possible combinations of trunk and foliage species to evaluate the impact of trunk characteristics on host selection in the presence of foliage. The most preferred trunk-foliage combinations, in descending order of percentage larvae found on each, were as follows: A. saccharum-B. papyrifera (41.0{\%}), B. papyrifera-B. papyrifera (19.0{\%}), A. saccharum-A. saccharum (14.8{\%}), B. papyrifera-A. saccharum (12.2{\%}), A. saccharum-F. pennsylvanica (2.2{\%}), and B. papyrifera-F. pennsylvanica (1.0{\%}). Both trunk species and foliage species Significantly influenced larval choice. The effect of tree canopy size, as measured by leaf surface area, on the distribution of larvae was measured in a forest clearing where five replications of 17 tree species and cultivars were planted. The tree species ranged from highly susceptible ( Malus sp.) to highly resistant ( Gleditsia triacanthos L.). The number of larvae per tree was explained well by the size of the leaf canopy for the six most preferred tree species and cultivars. This relationship did not exist for the remaining 11 species and cultivars of less preferred trees. Apparently, the size of preferred trees influences the distribution of gypsy moth larvae among them.},
annote = {-Why did the authors not use oak? That seems to be their most preferred host.

Trunk type (color, unclear if the trunks were different sizes [diameters]) seemed to have an overriding effect on foliage preference when presented in combination to larvae. Larvae overwhelmingly prefered Betula papyrifera (paper birch) foliage to Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Fraxinus pennsylvanica (ash) foliage. Larvae had an opposite preference in regards to trunks, A. saccharum and F. pennsylvanica trunks were preferred to B. papyrifera trunks. However, in combination A. saccharum trunk paired with B. papyrifera foliage was overwhelmingly preferred to any other trunk/foliage combination. Visual cues, for whatever reason, seem to be much more important to larval host choice than foliage.
-What does that mean for pupation site choice? Do late instar larvae exhibit a similar preference for pupation site choice (do they search for larger diameter or darker sites?)? Or are they merely looking for a safe site to pupate?},

abstract = {A digital ‘servosphere' locomotion-compensation apparatus has been developed for use in experiments on the mechanisms of spatial orientation in ambulatory animals. The sphere is driven by a pair of digital AC-servo motors, which provide a negative feedback response to any displacements of the test animal. A high-speed video tracker continually reports the position of the animal to a computer, which controls the servo-motors via a motor-control board and also logs the position of the motor axes. Movements of the servos define the path of the test animal on a virtual plane. The computer also generates odour cues in real time via a relay-control board and an airflow system. Odour presentation is programmed to occur in response to the animal's movements on the virtual plane, and can result in the animal being led to a virtual source. The servosphere was first used to investigate orientation of a walking male silkworm moth (Bombyx mori) towards a female in still air. When a calling female moth was placed beside the sphere, the male moth beat its wings and walked straight towards the female. Unilaterally dewinged males also walked in a straight line, though slightly to one side of the direction of the female, but bilaterally dewinged moths remained stationary. This indicates that in still air the male moths orientate to pheromone sources by fanning air from in front of them over their antennae with their wings. If a moth continually reverses its turning movements when it encounters a train of pheromone concentration peaks, it will maintain a course towards the source and eventually arrive there. This idea was demonstrated on the servosphere by incorporating a computer-controlled solenoid valve which releases pheromone when a moth points towards a virtual odour source. In this sensory field, both intact and bilaterally dewinged males reached the source irrespective of the wind direction. This result supports the proposed orientation mechanism and also demonstrates the applicability of the servosphere virtual-reality environment to the experimental investigation of insect orientation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The independent and interactive effects of temperature and dietary nitrogen content on performance of the gypsy moth (Lymannia dispar L.) were examined. In long-term feeding trials, larvae were reared from egg hatch to pupation on low (1.5{\%}) and high (3.7{\%} dry weight) nitrogen diets, under three temperature regimes. Short-term feeding trials with fourth instars and the same treatments were conducted in order to calculate nutritional indices. Higher temperatures did not influence larval survival and marginally increased final pupal weights, but strongly decreased long-term development rates. They also accelerated short-term growth and consumption rates, and tended to improve food processing efficiencies. High concentrations of dietary nitrogen increased survival rates and final pupal weights markedly, but decreased long-term development rates only marginally. A high content of dietary nitrogen also accelerated short-term development and growth rates, reduced consumption rates, and improved food digestibility. Insects responded to low nitrogen-content diets primarily by eating faster, rather than by altering efficiency of nitrogen use. In the short-term feeding trials, thermal regime and dietary nitrogen interacted to influence growth rates, overall food processing efficiencies and nitrogen consumption rates. No interactive effects were observed in long-term studies. This research demonstrates that small changes in thermal regime and ecologically relevant variation in dietary nitrogen content can strongly affect gypsy moth performance. Moreover, various performance parameters are differentially sensitive to the direct and interactive effects of temperature and diet.},

Larvae were lost from branch terminals, but usually at least 80{\%} were retained from one day to the next. I also carried out a mark-recapture study of large larvae in this same area, as well as in another area with a moderately high infestation. Caterpillars were marked by selectively removing prolegs. Dispersal patterns of larvae at both sites were similar and population densities were about 10,000 and 400,000 larvae per ha at the low- and high-population sites, respectively. Survival rates were highest at the high-population site. Estimated population values were closely correlated with the number of large caterpillars found under burlap bands, suggesting that the latter may usefully indicate absolute population levels},

The temporal staggering of these surveys allows investigation of seasonal components of population change, which we illustrate with an examination of the effects of severe winters on the Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus). Our analysis uses a hierarchical log-linear model with controls for survey-specific sampling covariates. Temporal change in population size is modeled seasonally, with covariates for winter severity. Overall, the winterspring seasons are associated with 82{\%} of the total population variation for Carolina Wrens, and an additional day of snow cover during winter spring is associated with an incremental decline of 1.1{\%} of the population.},

abstract = {Multiple regression, the General linear model (GLM) and the Generalized linear model (GLZ) are widely used in ecology. The widespread use of graphs that include fitted regression lines to document patterns in simple linear regression can be easily extended to these multivariate techniques in plots that show the partial relationship of the dependent variable with each independent variable. However, the latter procedure is not nearly as widely used in ecological studies. In fact, a brief review of the recent ecological literature showed that in ca 20{\%} of the papers the results of multiple regression are displayed by plotting the dependent variable against the raw values of the independent variable. This latter procedure may be misleading because the value of the partial slope may change in magnitude and even in sign relative to the slope obtained in simple least-squares regression. Plots of partial relationships should be used in these situations. Using numerical simulations and real data we show how displaying plots of partial relationships may also be useful for: 1) visualizing the true scatter of points around the partial regression line, and 2) identifying influential observations and non-linear patterns more efficiently than using plots of residuals vs fitted values. With the aim to help in the assessment of data quality, we show how partial residual plots (residuals from overall model + predicted values from the explanatory variable vs the explanatory variable) should only be used in restricted situations, and how partial regression plots (residuals of Y on the remaining explanatory variables vs residuals of the target explanatory variable on the remaining explanatory variables) should be the ones displayed in publications because they accurately reflect the scatter of partial correlations. Similarly, these partial plots can be applied to visualize the effect of continuous variables in GLM and GLZ for normal distributions and identity link functions.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that soil animal count data are characterized by the presence of excess zeros and overdispersion, which violate the assumptions of standard statistical tests. Despite this, analyses have consisted of mainly non-parametric tests and log-normal least square regression (i.e. ANOVA). Failure to accommodate zero inflation in count data can result in biased estimation of ecological effects jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific inference. The objective of this study was to compare statistical models for the analysis of soil animal count data and suggest appropriate methods for estimating abundance. The log-normal regression model, linear mixed model (LMM), standard Poisson, Poisson with correction for overdispersion (PCO), negative binomial distribution (NBD), the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models were compared using 12 count data sets of earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, beetles, ants and termites from soils under the miombo woodland and agroforestry systems in eastern Zambia. The NBD with covariates gave a better description of the data in nine out of 12 cases than did the standard Poisson, ZIP and ZINB. The ZIP and ZINB models with covariates gave the best description of earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts from agroforestry, respectively. In all cases, the ZIP model was better than the standard Poisson model. The ZINB was inferior to the NBD except for earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts in agroforestry. Significance tests based on the PCO, ZIP, NBD and ZINB were more conservative than those based on the standard Poisson model. The 95{\%} confidence intervals computed using the PCO, ZIP, NBD and ZINB were also wider than those computed using least squares, LMM and assuming Poisson distribution. It is concluded that for the comparison among habitat types, land-use categories or treatments, the NBD, ZIP and ZINB perform better than the log-normal and Poisson models. Considering the excess-zero problem and significant deviation of soil animal counts from the assumptions of normality and homoscedcity, the log-normal regression model is inappropriate. Therefore, routine application of the log-normal regression model and non-parametric tests for analysis of soil animal count data with many zeros should be discouraged. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {The introduction of high-quality, useable generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) software in the mid-2000s changed the conversation regarding the analysis of non-normal data from designed experiments. For well over half a century, the reigning paradigm called for using analysis of variance (ANOVA), either assuming approximate normality of the original data or applying a variance-stabilizing transformation. The appearance of GLMMs creates a dilemma. The ANOVA-based analyses and GLMM-based analyses often yield mutually contradictory results. What results should a researcher report, and how should the choice be justified? If GLMM-based analysis is preferred—and there is increasing evidence that this is the case—approaches to data analysis ingrained while learning ANOVA must be unlearned and relearned. The basic issues associated with the analysis of non-normal data are reviewed here, the thought processes required for GLMMs and how they differ from traditional ANOVA are introduced, and three examples are presented, giving an overview of GLMM-based analysis. The three examples include discussions of what is known to date about the relative merits of GLMM- and ANOVA-based analysis of non-normal data.},

@article{Gray2005a,
abstract = {The selection of a distributional assumption suitable for modelling macroinvertebrate density data is typically challenging. Macroinvertebrate data often exhibit substantially larger variances than expected under a standard count assumption, that of the Poisson distribution. Such overdispersion may derive from multiple sources, including heterogeneity of habitat (historically and spatially), differing life histories for organisms collected within a single collection in space and time, and autocorrelation. Taken to extreme, heterogeneity of habitat may be argued to explain the frequent large proportions of zero observations in macroinvertebrate data. Sampling locations may consist of habitats defined qualitatively as either suitable or unsuitable. The former category may yield random or stochastic zeroes and the latter structural zeroes. Heterogeneity among counts may be accommodated by treating the count mean itself as a random variable, while extra zeroes may be accommodated using zero-modified count assumptions, including zero-inflated and two-stage (or hurdle) approaches. These and linear assumptions (following log- and square root-transformations) were evaluated using 9 years of mayfly density data from a 52 km, ninth-order reach of the Upper Mississippi River (n = 959). The data exhibited substantial overdispersion relative to that expected under a Poisson assumption (i.e. variance:mean ratio = 23 ≫ 1), and 43{\%} of the sampling locations yielded zero mayflies. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), count models were improved most by treating the count mean as a random variable (via a Poisson-gamma distributional assumption) and secondarily by zero modification (i.e. improvements in AIC values = 9184 units and 47-48 units, respectively). Zeroes were underestimated by the Poisson, log-transform and square root-transform models, slightly by the standard negative binomial model but not by the zero-modified models (61{\%}, 24{\%}, 32{\%}, 7{\%}, and 0{\%}, respectively). However, the zero-modified Poisson models underestimated small counts (1 ≤ y ≤ 4) and overestimated intermediate counts (7 ≤ y ≤ 23). Counts greater than zero were estimated well by zero-modified negative binomial models, while counts greater than one were also estimated well by the standard negative binomial model. Based on AIC and percent zero estimation criteria, the two-stage and zero-inflated models performed similarly. The above inferences were largely confirmed when the models were used to predict values from a separate, evaluation data set (n = 110). An exception was that, using the evaluation data set, the standard negative binomial model appeared superior to its zero-modified counterparts using the AIC (but not percent zero criteria). This and other evidence suggest that a negative binomial distributional assumption should be routinely considered when modelling benthic macroinvertebrate data from low flow environments. Whether negative binomial models should themselves be routinely examined for extra zeroes requires, from a statistical perspective, more investigation. However, this question may best be answered by ecological arguments that may be specific to the sampled species and locations. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Determining the strengths of interactions among species in natural com-munities presents a major challenge to ecology. Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among other unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and Mytilus abundance because of space competition; (c) Mytilus reduces Semibalanus cover through competition for space; and (d) as prey species, Semibalanus and Pollicipes enhance Nucella density, but Nucella pre-dation does not have important effects on Semibalanus or Pollicipes. Based on the estimated strength of direct interactions, the importance of indirect effects among species could also be predicted. In experiments manipulating Nucella, Pollicipes, Semibalanus, and birds independently of one another, I tested 11 of the interactions predicted by the path analysis; all were supported. Path analysis in conjunction with limited experiments may provide an efficient means to predict important direct and indirect interactions among unmanipulated species within ecological communities.},

Further, we argue that, although multimodel inference can be useful in natural resource management, the importance of considering causality and accurately estimating effect sizes is greater than simply considering a variety of models. Determining causation is far more valuable than simply indicating how the response variable and explanatory variables covaried within a data set, especially when the data set did not arise from a controlled experiment.

abstract = {Sightability models are binary logistic-regression models used to estimate and adjust for visibility bias in wildlife-population surveys. Like many models in wildlife and ecology, sightability models are typically developed from small observational datasets with many candidate predictors. Aggressive model-selection methods are often employed to choose a best model for prediction and effect estimation, despite evidence that such methods can lead to overfitting (i.e., selected models may describe random error or noise rather than true predictor–response curves) and poor predictive ability. We used moose (Alces alces) sightability data from northeastern Minnesota (2005–2007) as a case study to illustrate an alternative approach, which we refer to as degrees-of-freedom (df) spending: sample-size guidelines are used to determine an acceptable level of model complexity and then a pre-specified model is fit to the data and used for inference. For comparison, we also constructed sightability models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) step-down procedures and model averaging (based on a small set of models developed using df-spending guidelines). We used bootstrap procedures to mimic the process of model fitting and prediction, and to compute an index of overfitting, expected predictive accuracy, and model-selection uncertainty. The index of overfitting increased 13$\backslash${\%} when the number of candidate predictors was increased from three to eight and a best model was selected using step-down procedures. Likewise, model-selection uncertainty increased when the number of candidate predictors increased. Model averaging (based on R = 30 models with 1–3 predictors) effectively shrunk regression coefficients toward zero and produced similar estimates of precision to our 3-df pre-specified model. As such, model averaging may help to guard against overfitting when too many predictors are considered (relative to available sample size). The set of candidate models will influence the extent to which coefficients are shrunk toward zero, which has implications for how one might apply model averaging to problems traditionally approached using variable-selection methods. We often recommend the df-spending approach in our consulting work because it is easy to implement and it naturally forces investigators to think carefully about their models and predictors. Nonetheless, similar concepts should apply whether one is fitting 1 model or using multi-model inference. For example, model-building decisions should consider the effective sample size, and potential predictors should be screened (without looking at their relationship to the response) for missing data, narrow distributions, collinearity, potentially overly influential observations, and measurement errors (e.g., via logical error checks).},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.},

While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

A worldwide survey of 73 principal investigators (Pls) with long-term studies revealed positive attitudes towards sharing data with the agreement or involvement of the PI, and 93{\%} of PIs have historically shared data. Only 8{\%} were in favor of uncontrolled, open access to primary data while 63{\%} expressed serious concern. We present here their viewpoint on an issue that can have non-trivial scientific consequences. We discuss potential costs of public data archiving and provide possible solutions to meet the needs of journals and researchers. Public data archiving is the archiving of primary data used in publications so that they can be preserved and made accessible to all online. Public data archiving is increasingly required by journals. However, the costs of public data archiving might be underestimated, in particular with respect to long-term studies. Long-term studies have been responsible for the answers to many important questions in evolution and ecology which could only be answered through following the life-histories of individuals for decades. Several papers have been published in favor of public data archiving, but a more balanced viewpoint is necessary to allow a discussion to emerge on a code of ethics and ways to preserve and protect the data, encourage the initiation and continuation of long-term studies, and meet the requirements of the whole scientific community.},

We earlier reviewed the many grounds for not regarding them as such. To have at least some power for detection of effects in the unpredicted direction, several authors have independently proposed the use of lopsided (also termed split-tailed, directed or one-and-a-half-tailed) tests, two-tailed tests with $\alpha$ partitionedunequally between the two tails of the test statistic distribution. We review the history ofthese proposals and conclude that lopsided tests are never justified. They are based on thesame misunderstandings that have led to massive misuse of one-tailed tests as well as tomuch needless worry, for more than half a century, over the various so-called ‘multiplicity problems'. We discuss from a neo-Fisherian point of view the undesirable properties of multiple comparison procedures based on either (i) maximum potential set-wise (or familywise) type I error rates (SWERs), or (ii) the increasingly fashionable, maximum potential false discovery rates (FDRs). Neither the classical nor the newer multiple comparison procedures based on fixed maximum potential set-wise error rates are helpful to the cogent analysis and interpretation of scientific data.},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-{\$}t{\$} prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

abstract = {1. Perhaps no other pair of variables in ecology has generated as much discussion as species richness and ecosystem productivity, as illustrated by the reactions by Pierce (2013) and others to Adler et al.'s (2011) report that empirical patterns are weak and inconsistent. Adler et al. (2011) argued we need to move beyond a focus on simplistic bivariate relationships and test mechanistic, multivariate causal hypotheses. We feel the continuing debate over productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) provides a focused context for illustrating the fundamental difficulties of using bivariate relationships to gain scientific understanding. 2. Pierce (2013) disputes Adler et al.'s (2011) conclusion that bivariate productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) are “weak and variable.” He argues, instead, that relationships in the Adler et al. data are actually strong and, further, that failure to adhere to the humped-back model (HBM; sensu Grime 1979) threatens scientists' ability to advise conservationists. Here we show that Pierce's reanalyses are invalid, that statistically significant boundary relations in the Adler et al. data are difficult to detect when proper methods are used, and that his advice neither advances scientific understanding nor provides the quantitative forecasts actually needed by decision makers. 3. We begin by examining Grimes' HBM through the lens of causal networks. We first translate the ideas contained in the HBM into a causal diagram, which shows explicitly how multiple processes are hypothesized to control biomass production and richness and their interrelationship. We then evaluate the causal diagram using structural equation modeling and example data from a published study of meadows in Finland. Formal analysis rejects the literal translation of the HBM and reveals additional processes at work. This exercise shows how the practice of abstracting systems as causal networks (1) clarifies possible hypotheses, (2) permits explicit testing, and (3) provides more powerful and useful predictions. 4. Building on the Finnish meadow example, we contrast the utility of bivariate plots compared to structural equation models for investigating underlying processes. Simulations illustrate the fallibility of bivariate analysis as a means of supporting one theory over another, while models based on causal networks can quantify the sensitivity of diversity patterns to both management and natural constraints. 5. A key piece of Pierce's critique of Adler et al.'s conclusions relies on upper boundary regression which he claims to reveal strong relationships between production and richness in Adler et al.'s original data. We demonstrate that this technique shows strong associations in purely random data and is invalid for Adler et al.'s data because it depends on a uniform data distribution. We instead perform quantile regression on both the site-level summaries of the data and the plot-level data (using mixed- model quantile regression). Using a variety of nonlinear curve-fitting approaches, we were unable to detect a significant humped-shape boundary in the Adler et al. data. We reiterate that the bivariate productivity-richness relationships in Adler et al.'s data are weak and variable. 6. We urge ecologists to consider productivity-richness relationships through the lens of causal networks to advance our understanding beyond bivariate analysis. Further, we emphasize that models based on a causal network conceptualization can also provide more meaningful guidance for conservation management than can a bivariate perspective. Measuring only two variables does not permit the evaluation of complex ideas nor resolve debates about underlying mechanisms.},

However, many biologists are not certain of methods to derive sampling variance for parameters when survival rates change temporal scales. Similar methods are needed to obtain sampling variance when biologists combine parameter estimates to calculate an indirect demographic parameter, such as population growth rate. The delta method is a useful technique for approximating sampling variance when the desired demographic parameter is a function of at least one other demographic parameter. However, the delta method is rarely taught in most graduate-level biology or ecology courses, and application of this method may be discouraged by seemingly daunting formulas in reference books. Here, I provide five examples of sampling variance approximations for common situations encountered by avian ecologists, with step-by-step explanations of the equations involved.},

abstract = {1. Inference about demographic parameters of animal and plant natural populations is important to evaluate the consequences of global changes on populations. Investigating the factors driving their variation over space and time allows evaluating the relative importance of biotic and abiotic variables in shaping the dynamics of a population. Although numerous studies have identified the factors possibly affecting population dynamics, they have barely formally determined the routes by which these different factors are related to demographic parameters. 2. We focus on mark–recapture (MR) models that provide unbiased estimators of demographic parameters,while explicitly coping with imperfect detection inherent to wild populations.MRmod- els allow estimating the effect of covariates on demographic parameters and testing their signifi- cance in a regression-like framework. However, these models can only detect correlations and do not inform on causal pathways (e.g. direct vs. indirect effects) in the relationships between demo- graphic parameters and the factors possibly explaining their variability. 3. We develop an integrated model to perform path analysis (PA) ofMRdata, to examine causal relationships among several (including demographic) variables. This approach is implemented in a Bayesian framework usingMarkov chainMonte Carlo. 4. To motivate our developments, we analyse 17 years of mark–recapture data from Atlantic puf- fins (Fratercula arctica), to investigate the mechanisms through which environmental conditions have an impact on puffins' adult survival. Using our PA-basedMRmodelling approach, we found that local climatic conditions had an indirect and lagged impact on puffin survival through their influence on local abundance of herring. Besides, we found no evidence for any lagged effect through an alternative unknownpathway (e.g. abundance of another resource). 5.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence--with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies--is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices--automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables--are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

abstract = {This essay grew out of an examination of one-tailed significance testing. One-tailed tests were little advocated by the founders of modern statistics but are widely used and recommended nowadays in the biological, behavioral and social sciences. The high frequency of their use in ecology and animal behavior and their logical indefensibility have been documented in a companion review paper. In the present one, we trace the roots of this problem and counter some attacks on significance testing in general. Roots include: the early but irrational dichotomization of the P scale and adoption of the `significant/non-significant' terminology; the mistaken notion that a high P value is evidence favoring the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis; and confusion over the distinction between statistical and research hypotheses. Resultant widespread misuse and misinterpretation of significance tests have also led to other problems, such as unjustifiable demands that reporting of P values be disallowed or greatly reduced and that reporting of confidence intervals and standardized effect sizes be required in their place. Our analysis of these matters thus leads us to a recommendation that for standard types of significance assessment the paleoFisherian and Neyman-Pearsonian paradigms be replaced by a neoFisherian one. The essence of the latter is that a critical [alpha] (probability of type I error) is not specified, the terms 'significant' and 'non-significant' are abandoned, that high P values lead only to suspended judgments, and that the so-called "three-valued logic" of Cox, Kaiser, Tukey, Tryon and Harris is adopted explicitly. Confidence intervals and bands, power analyses, and severity curves remain useful adjuncts in particular situations. Analyses conducted under this paradigm we term neoFisherian significance assessments (NFSA). Their role is assessment of the existence, sign and magnitude of statistical effects. The common label of null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) is retained for paleoFisherian and Neyman-Pearsonian approaches and their hybrids. The original Neyman-Pearson framework has no utility outside quality control type applications. Some advocates of Bayesian, likelihood and information-theoretic approaches to model selection have argued that P values and NFSAs are of little or no value, but those arguments do not withstand critical review. Champions of Bayesian methods in particular continue to overstate their value and relevance.},

abstract = {Error statistics has a dual dimension involving philosophy and methodology. It refers to a standpoint regarding both: a cluster of statistical tools, their interpretation and justification; and a general philosophy of science, and the roles probability plays in inductive inference. Comparison of error statistical approach to other philosophies of statistics requires understanding the complex interconnections between the methodological and philosophical dimensions. This chapter focuses on the error statistical philosophy and concerns the interplay between the philosophical, methodological, and statistical issues, to elucidate long-standing conceptual, technical, and epistemological debates surrounding both dimensions. Standard explications of statistical methods focus on the formal mathematical tools without considering a general philosophy of science or of induction in which these tools best fit. Finally, this chapter deals with statistical methods of testing and estimation while simultaneously highlighting classic misunderstandings and fallacies. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are useful tools for modeling ecological predictions and aiding resource- management decision-making. We provide practical guidelines for developing, testing, and revising BBNs. Primary steps in this process include creating influence diagrams of the hypothesized "causal web" of key factors affecting a species or ecological outcome of interest; developing a first, alpha-level BBN model from the influence diagram; revis- ing the model after expert review; testing and calibrating the model with case hles to create a beta-level model; and updating the model structure and conditional probabilities with new validation data, creating the final-application gamma-level model. We illustrate and discuss these steps with an empirically based BBN model of factors influencing probability of capture of northern flying squirrels (Ghucomys sabrinus (Shaw)). Testing and updating BBNs, especially with peer review and calibration, are essential to ensure their credibility and reduce bias. Our guidelines provide mod- elers with insights that allow them to avoid potentially spurious or unreliable models. R{\&}umi!},

abstract = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.},

abstract = {Two types of ecological thresholds are now being widely used to develop conservation targets: breakpoint-based thresholds represent tipping points where system properties change dramatically, whereas classification thresholds identify groups of data points with contrasting properties. Both breakpoint-based and classification thresholds are useful tools in evidence-based conservation. However, it is critical that the type of threshold to be estimated corresponds with the question of interest and that appropriate statistical procedures are used to determine its location. On the basis of their statistical properties, we recommend using piecewise regression methods to identify breakpoint-based thresholds and discriminant analysis or classification and regression trees to identify classification thresholds.},

abstract = {Studies in ecology are often describing observed variations in a certain ecological phenomenon by use of environmental explanatory variables. A common problem is that the numerical nature of the ecological phenomenon does not always fit the assumptions underlying traditional statistical tests. A text book example comes from pollination ecology where flower visits are normally reported as frequencies; number of visits per flower per unit time. Using visitation frequencies in statistical analyses comes with two major caveats: the lack of knowledge on its error distribution and that it does not include all information found in the data; 10 flower visits in 20 flowers is treated the same as recording 100 visits in 200 flowers. We simulated datasets with various "flower visitation distributions" over various numbers of flowers observed (exposure) and with different types of effects inducing variation in the data. The different datasets were then analyzed first with the traditional approach using number of visits per flower and then by using count data models. The analysis of count data gave a much better chance of detecting effects than the traditionally used frequency approach. We conclude that if the data structure, statistical analyses and interpretations of results are mixed up, valuable information can be lost.},

@article{Grace2010c,
abstract = {The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) is often motivated by its utility for investigating complex networks of relationships, but also because of its promise as a means of representing theoretical concepts using latent variables. In this paper, we discuss characteristics of ecological theory and some of the challenges for proper specification of theoretical ideas in structural equation models (SE models). In our presentation, we describe some of the requirements for classical latent variable models in which observed variables (indicators) are interpreted as the effects of underlying causes. We also describe alternative model specifications in which indicators are interpreted as having causal influences on the theoretical concepts. We suggest that this latter nonclassical specification (which involves another variable type—the composite) will often be appropriate for ecological studies because of the multifaceted nature of our theoretical concepts. In this paper, we employ the use of meta-models to aid the translation of theory into SE models and also to facilitate our ability to relate results back to our theories. We demonstrate our approach by showing how a synthetic theory of grassland biodiversity can be evaluated using SEM and data from a coastal grassland. In this example, the theory focuses on the responses of species richness to abiotic stress and disturbance, both directly and through intervening effects on community biomass. Models examined include both those based on classical forms (where each concept is represented using a single latent variable) and also ones in which the concepts are recognized to be multifaceted and modeled as such. To address the challenge of matching SE models with the conceptual level of our theory, two approaches are illustrated, compositing and aggregation. Both approaches are shown to have merits, with the former being preferable for cases where the multiple facets of a concept have widely differing effects in the system and the latter being preferable where facets act together consistently when influencing other parts of the system. Because ecological theory characteristically deals with concepts that are multifaceted, we expect the methods presented in this paper will be useful for ecologists wishing to use SEM.},

abstract = {We assessed the relative influence of total phosphorus and piscivore biomass on the abundance of benthivores, soft-rayed planktivores, spiny-rayed planktivores, zooplankton and phytoplankton in 69 shallow lakes in the prairie and parkland areas of Minnesota, USA. Piscivore biomass was the best predictor for three of these response variables, exhibiting a negative relationship with soft-rayed planktivores, a positive relationship with benthivores, and a weaker positive relationship with large-bodied cladocerans. Total phosphorus and piscivores comprised the best model for predicting spiny-rayed planktivores, while neither variable showed any strong relationship to small-bodied cladocerans. Total phosphorus was positively related to phytoplankton abundance, and was the best predictor among all candidate models. Moreover, contrary to predictions of trophic cascade theory, the relationship between chlorophyll a and total phosphorus did not differ between lakes with and without piscivores. Our results indicated top-down influences of piscivores extended through parts of two trophic levels, but failed to influence zooplankton – phytoplankton interactions, leaving phytoplankton abundance constrained largely by total phosphorus. Lack of a relationship between piscivores and phytoplankton was likely due to high densities of larval planktivores less susceptible to piscivory, as well as positive influences of spiny-rayed planktivores and benthivores on algal abundance. These results support the idea that top–down influences of piscivores on phytoplankton abundance may be reduced in more diverse fish communities where some prey species are less susceptible to piscivory.},
