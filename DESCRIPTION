Description: Functions that facilitate and speed up the analysis of data
    produced by a servosphere. This package is also designed to make working
    with data produced from a servosphere easy for someone new to or unfamiliar
    with R. The functions provided in this package fall into three broad-use
    categories: functions for cleaning raw data produced by the servosphere
    software, functions for deriving movement variables based on position data,
    and functions for summarizing movement variables for easier analysis. These
    functions are built with functions from the tidyverse package to work
    efficiently, as a single servosphere file may consist of hundreds of
    thousands of rows of data.
