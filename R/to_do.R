# To do list:
# Figure out a way to merge important trial ID info with the summarized
# variables. Probably something to do with getting a vector of column names from
# each data frame and the summary df and then figuring out which variables need
# to be added to the summary_df. The problem right now has to do with workflow.
# Depending on when the user uses different functions they may or may not have
# already specified which columns to keep.

# Add to the functions so the user can split data frames by stimuli and analyze
# separately
