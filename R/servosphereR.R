#' servosphereR: A package to facilitate cleaning and analyzing data produced by a servosphere.
#'
#' A servosphere, or locomotory compensator, is a device that can be used to
#' study the movement of insects or other small critters. A servosphere consists
#' of a ball that rests on top of motors. A camera pointed at the top of the
#' sphere watches the insect as it moves and reports position changes to the
#' motors. As the insect moves, the motors rotate to keep the insect positioned
#' at the top of the sphere.
